DEFECT	fixme formatters are not thread safe
DEFECT	xxx jon skeet the comment if it hasn t been done already may not be strictly true. wrapper.maybeconfigure won t configure the same attributes text more than once but it may well add the children again unless i ve missed something.
DEFECT	i hate to admit it but we don t know what happened here. throw the exception.
DEFECT	just a note starteam has a status for new which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository. these are the items that show up as not in view in the starteam gui. one would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the new items not in all cases! steve cohen 15 dec 2001 unfortunately the sdk doesn t really work and we can t actually see anything with a status of new. that is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything.
DEFECT	the generated classes must not be added in the generic jar! is that buggy on old jonas 2.4 ??
DEFECT	this is turned off temporarily. there appears to be a bug in selectorutils.matchpattern where it is recursive on windows even if no is in pattern. assertequals ffftffffffff results unix vs assertequals ffftfffftfff results windows
DEFECT	pattern now holds while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that.
DEFECT	fixme is no namespace is empty namespace really ok?
DEFECT	fixme this is actually not very cpu cycles friendly as we are converting from dos to java while the underlying sun implementation will convert from java to dos time for internal storage...
DEFECT	check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several times. this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases.
DEFECT	todo a warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will cause some trouble. the parser should definitely be much better.
DEFECT	todo is this comment still relevant ?? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
DESIGN	xxx i really don t like this the xml processor is still. too involved in the processing. a better solution imo . would be to create ue for project and target too and. then process the tree and have project target deal with. its attributes similar with description .. . if we eventually switch to or add support for dom . things will work smoothly ue can be avoided almost completely. it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility .
DESIGN	junit 4 wraps solo tests this way. we can extract the original test name with a little hack.
DESIGN	xxx ignore attributes in a different ns maybe store them ?
DESIGN	borrowed from tokenfiltertest
DESIGN	xxx move to project so it is shared by all helpers
DESIGN	what is the property supposed to be?
DESIGN	pr hack for ant type value an ant type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri name
DESIGN	there s a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
DESIGN	stolen from org.apache.xerces.impl.xmlentitymanager getuserdir of the xerces j team which ascii characters need to be escaped
DESIGN	bingo append it. this should normally not be done here
DESIGN	this is faintly ridiculous
DESIGN	cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility
DESIGN	todo not read yet in a public setter
DESIGN	pr i do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only...
DESIGN	not sure what could be the need of this...
DESIGN	xxx jon skeet any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure ?
DESIGN	experimental testing will be removed
DESIGN	xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container.touri .tourl and the same permissioncollection as project.class.protectiondomain had
DESIGN	this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
DESIGN	xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards can be written better... this is too hacky!
DESIGN	silly hack to avoid stack overflow...
DESIGN	access to property tables this is used to support ant call and similar tasks. it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better more efficient mechanism to preserve the context.
DESIGN	temporary until we figure a better api
DESIGN	there is a better way to save the context. this shouldn t delegate to next it s for backward compatibility only.
DESIGN	quick fix for ant.java use of property before initializing the project
DESIGN	xxx we should use jcvs www.ice.com jcvs instead of command line execution so that we don t rely on having native cvs stuff around sm
DESIGN	. two reasons are mentioned in the api docs for file.list. 1 dir is not a directory. this is impossible as. we wouldn t get here in this case.. 2 an io error occurred why doesn t it throw an exception. then??? .
DESIGN	. jakarta commons logging listener.. note do not use the simplelog as your logger implementation as it. causes an infinite loop since it writes to system.err which ant traps. and reroutes to the logger listener layer.. . the following names are used for the log . org.apache.tools.ant.project.project name for project events. org.apache.tools.ant.target.target name for target events. task class name.target name for events in individual targets.. . in all target and project names we replace . and with .. . todo we should use the advanced context logging features and expose them. in c l first . todo this is very inefficient. switching the out and tracking the logs. can be optimized a lot but may require few more changes to the core.. . since ant 1.5.
DESIGN	todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it. this should probably be modified to use the classname instead.
DESIGN	these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us.
DESIGN	. this is a rather hairy case.. . one of our subclasses knows that we need to update the. archive but at the same time there are no resources. known to us that would need to be added. only the. subclass seems to know what s going on.. . this happens if jar detects that the manifest has changed . for example. the manifest is not part of any resources. because of our support for inline manifest s.. . if we invoke createemptyzip like ant 1.5.2 did . we ll loose all stuff that has been in the original. archive bugzilla report 17780 ..
DESIGN	this is deprecated use classespath in the future
DESIGN	xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials.. gotta remove.
DESIGN	. set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a. target is out of date.. todo this is not yet used.. param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of. date..
DESIGN	this may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities.
DESIGN	we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error warning xxx is this correct?
DESIGN	the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
DESIGN	xxx what is the following doing? should it run if !javadoc4 executable ! null?
DESIGN	mac os 9 and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
DESIGN	todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter.
DESIGN	xxx we are committing combiningchar and extender here
DESIGN	. xxx failed to load the class properly.. . should we print a warning here?.
DESIGN	xxx could perhaps also call thread.stop not sure if anyone cares
DESIGN	. xxx. perhaps we shouldn t use properties for these. three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic . but include it in the javac directive?.
DESIGN	xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement other patterns ?
DESIGN	todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc. you have to provide the rules in the constructors no setters available.
DESIGN	probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in classpath
DESIGN	fix for invalid characters. if you think of more add to the list.
DESIGN	. fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or. don t know how to handle it there is no easy way to. know what idl mode would generate.. . this is supposed to make ant always recompile the. class as a file of that name should not exist..
DESIGN	check it out also ugly.
DESIGN	i can t get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here?
DESIGN	quick dirty to make nested mapped p sets work
DESIGN	xxx is this code still necessary? is there any 1.2 port? pull in .zip from packages directory
DESIGN	only the developer knows what s he is doing
DESIGN	xxx unfortunately jdk1.2 adds entryset keyset values implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later.
DESIGN	first developer could use a little help
DESIGN	xxx should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation?
DESIGN	since java 1.4 return normalizedpath.split workaround for java 1.2 1.3
DESIGN	hammer end inline maingtu
DESIGN	. this array really shouldn t be here.. again for historical purposes it is.. . p fixme this array should be in a private or package private. location since it could be modified by malicious code. p .
DESIGN	should move to a separate public class and have api to add listeners etc.
DESIGN	should become a single empty argument same for pr 5906
DESIGN	not very nice but will do the job
DESIGN	provide public visibility
DESIGN	not used but public so theoretically must remain for bc?
DESIGN	super.validateattributes don t want to call this method
DESIGN	xxx what is this for?
DESIGN	we keep this so we have something to delete in later tests
DESIGN	copied from concattest
DESIGN	not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions.
DESIGN	we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up. do we need to do this? lh
DESIGN	why do we do nothing?
DESIGN	this is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath. the code is currently the same you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files.
DESIGN	xxx why not simply new file dir filename ?
DESIGN	this is ugly checking for the root folder.
DESIGN	todo parameterise ?? call compiler as class... dont want to fork again use classic compiler can be parameterised?
DESIGN	xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better... this is too hacky! careful.. similar code in scandir but slightly different!!
DESIGN	stolen from writemanifest
DESIGN	if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it.. should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this. so that in case of errors we don t leave people worse off. than when we started .
DESIGN	xxx is the following really necessary? it is in the same thread group...
DESIGN	we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
DESIGN	this is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	for script example that modifies id ed tasks in other targets to work. very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable
DESIGN	don t call super.close because that reader is used on other places ...
DESIGN	report error if something weird happens...this is diagnostic.
DESIGN	sorry otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader ...
DESIGN	hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor.
DESIGN	singleton for now it may change per classloader
DESIGN	xxx shouldn t this always return false in isolated mode?
IMPLEMENTATION	to do delete the file if it is not a valid file.
IMPLEMENTATION	. this method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the code . ejbfiles code and compares them to the timestamp on the code jarfile. code . if the code jarfile code s timestamp is more recent than. each ejb file code true code is returned. otherwise code false. code is returned.. todo find a way to check the manifest file that is found by naming convention. . param ejbfiles hashtable of ejb classes and other files that will be. added to the completed jar file. param jarfile jar file which will contain all of the ejb classes and. other files. return boolean indicating whether or not the code jarfile code . is up to date.

IMPLEMENTATION	. the displayname variable stores the value of the display name element. from the standard ejb descriptor. as a future enhancement to this task . we may determine the name of the ejb jar file using this display name . but this has not be implemented yet..
IMPLEMENTATION	. an output stream that compresses into the bzip2 format without the file. header chars into another stream.. . p the compression requires large amounts of memory. thus you. should call the link close close method as soon as. possible to force tt cbzip2outputstream tt to release the. allocated memory. p . . p you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise. the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn. may cause a lower compression ratio. you can avoid unnecessary. memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger. than the size of the input. p . . p you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the. following formula p . pre . code 400k 9 blocksize code .. pre . . p to get the memory required for decompression by link. cbzip2inputstream cbzip2inputstream use p . pre . code 65k 5 blocksize code .. pre . . table width 100 border 1 . colgroup . col width 33 . col width 33 . col width 33 . colgroup . tr . th colspan 3 memory usage by blocksize th . tr tr . th align right blocksize th . th align right compression br memory usage th . th align right decompression br memory usage th . tr tr . td align right 100k td . td align right 1300k td . td align right 565k td . tr tr . td align right 200k td . td align right 2200k td . td align right 1065k td . tr tr . td align right 300k td . td align right 3100k td . td align right 1565k td . tr tr . td align right 400k td . td align right 4000k td . td align right 2065k td . tr tr . td align right 500k td . td align right 4900k td . td align right 2565k td . tr tr . td align right 600k td . td align right 5800k td . td align right 3065k td . tr tr . td align right 700k td . td align right 6700k td . td align right 3565k td . tr tr . td align right 800k td . td align right 7600k td . td align right 4065k td . tr tr . td align right 900k td . td align right 8500k td . td align right 4565k td . tr . table . . p for decompression tt cbzip2inputstream tt allocates less. memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block. p . . p instances of this class are not threadsafe. p . . p . todo update to bzip2 1.0.1. p . .
IMPLEMENTATION	xxx log an error? throw an exception?

TEST	junit3 test assertequals error junittestrunner.failures runner.getretcode fixme as of now does not report the original stacktrace. asserttrue error error.indexof thrown on purpose ! 1
TEST	the property is an id s thing either a property or a path. we need to make sure that the object was created with the given id. we don t have an adequate way of testing the actual value of the path object though...
TEST	where oh where has my test case 3 gone?
TEST	attribute names and values. while the xml spec doesn t require. preserving the order afaik some ant tests do rely on the. exact order. the following code is copied from attributeimpl.. we could also just use sax2 attributes and convert to sax1 dom. attribute nodes can also be stored in sax2 attributes . xxx under jdk 1.4 you can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick. the only exception to this order is the treatment of. refid. a number of datatypes check if refid is set. when other attributes are set. this check will not. work if the build script has the other attribute before. the refid attribute so now ant 1.7 the refid. attribute will be processed first..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we first run a dfs based sort using each root as a starting node. this creates the minimum sequence of targets to the root node s . we then do a sort on any remaining unvisited targets. this is unnecessary for doing our build but it catches circular dependencies or missing targets on the entire dependency tree not just on the targets that depend on the build target.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in vm is not very nice since it could probably hang the whole build. imho this method should be avoided and it would be best to remove it in future versions. tbd. sba
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will cause trouble in jdk 1.1 if omitted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now find available running slots for the remaining threads
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	replace the file s extension with .java
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	change the directory
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	continue on outer while loop to get another available slot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first search for the old javah class in 1.4.2 tools.jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this actually relies on the first manifest being found on the classpath probably rt.jar s being valid
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we got here all slots in use so sleep until something happens
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume older than 1.4.2 tools.jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	required attributes deprecated! use this going forward
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	are all threads finished

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	int version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	read the constant pool.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this one is here because the changes to support resourcecollections have broken magic s junittesttask. the task adds a fileset to a batchtest instance using the java api and without telling the fileset about its project instance. the original code would pass in project on the call to getdirectoryscanner which is now hidden deep into resources.iterator and not reachable.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inform ih to clear the cache

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	try a multi part netware volume length path see how it is handled
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	be sure everything has been set.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for a static suite method first even when using junit 4
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for jdk 5 first. will not help on jdk 1.4 if only junit 4.0.jar in cp because in that case linkage of whole task will already have failed! but will help if cp has junit 3.8.2.jar junit 4.0.jar.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	methods to override
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note don t need to specify size or crc for compressed files.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not strictly necessary but probably desirable. junit 4 specific test guis will show just failures . but ant s output shows failures vs. errors . we would prefer to show failure for things that logically are.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the systemclasspath as well to include the ant jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finally set the property
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. necessary in the case where you add a entry that. is not compressed..
