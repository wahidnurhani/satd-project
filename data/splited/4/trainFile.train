DEFECT	fixme formatters are not thread safe
DEFECT	xxx jon skeet the comment if it hasn t been done already may not be strictly true. wrapper.maybeconfigure won t configure the same attributes text more than once but it may well add the children again unless i ve missed something.
DEFECT	i hate to admit it but we don t know what happened here. throw the exception.
DEFECT	just a note starteam has a status for new which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository. these are the items that show up as not in view in the starteam gui. one would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the new items not in all cases! steve cohen 15 dec 2001 unfortunately the sdk doesn t really work and we can t actually see anything with a status of new. that is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything.
DEFECT	the generated classes must not be added in the generic jar! is that buggy on old jonas 2.4 ??
DEFECT	this is turned off temporarily. there appears to be a bug in selectorutils.matchpattern where it is recursive on windows even if no is in pattern. assertequals ffftffffffff results unix vs assertequals ffftfffftfff results windows
DEFECT	pattern now holds while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that.
DEFECT	fixme is no namespace is empty namespace really ok?
DEFECT	fixme this is actually not very cpu cycles friendly as we are converting from dos to java while the underlying sun implementation will convert from java to dos time for internal storage...
DEFECT	check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several times. this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases.
DEFECT	todo a warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will cause some trouble. the parser should definitely be much better.
DEFECT	todo is this comment still relevant ?? fixme need to use a saxsource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
DESIGN	xxx i really don t like this the xml processor is still. too involved in the processing. a better solution imo . would be to create ue for project and target too and. then process the tree and have project target deal with. its attributes similar with description .. . if we eventually switch to or add support for dom . things will work smoothly ue can be avoided almost completely. it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility .
DESIGN	junit 4 wraps solo tests this way. we can extract the original test name with a little hack.
DESIGN	xxx ignore attributes in a different ns maybe store them ?
DESIGN	borrowed from tokenfiltertest
DESIGN	xxx move to project so it is shared by all helpers
DESIGN	what is the property supposed to be?
DESIGN	pr hack for ant type value an ant type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri name
DESIGN	there s a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
DESIGN	stolen from org.apache.xerces.impl.xmlentitymanager getuserdir of the xerces j team which ascii characters need to be escaped
DESIGN	bingo append it. this should normally not be done here
DESIGN	this is faintly ridiculous
DESIGN	cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility
DESIGN	todo not read yet in a public setter
DESIGN	pr i do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only...
DESIGN	not sure what could be the need of this...
DESIGN	xxx jon skeet any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure ?
DESIGN	experimental testing will be removed
DESIGN	xxx should instead make a new protectiondomain with a codesource corresponding to container.touri .tourl and the same permissioncollection as project.class.protectiondomain had
DESIGN	this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
DESIGN	xxx all this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards can be written better... this is too hacky!
DESIGN	silly hack to avoid stack overflow...
DESIGN	access to property tables this is used to support ant call and similar tasks. it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better more efficient mechanism to preserve the context.
DESIGN	temporary until we figure a better api
DESIGN	there is a better way to save the context. this shouldn t delegate to next it s for backward compatibility only.
DESIGN	quick fix for ant.java use of property before initializing the project
DESIGN	xxx we should use jcvs www.ice.com jcvs instead of command line execution so that we don t rely on having native cvs stuff around sm
DESIGN	. two reasons are mentioned in the api docs for file.list. 1 dir is not a directory. this is impossible as. we wouldn t get here in this case.. 2 an io error occurred why doesn t it throw an exception. then??? .
DESIGN	. jakarta commons logging listener.. note do not use the simplelog as your logger implementation as it. causes an infinite loop since it writes to system.err which ant traps. and reroutes to the logger listener layer.. . the following names are used for the log . org.apache.tools.ant.project.project name for project events. org.apache.tools.ant.target.target name for target events. task class name.target name for events in individual targets.. . in all target and project names we replace . and with .. . todo we should use the advanced context logging features and expose them. in c l first . todo this is very inefficient. switching the out and tracking the logs. can be optimized a lot but may require few more changes to the core.. . since ant 1.5.
DESIGN	todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it. this should probably be modified to use the classname instead.
DESIGN	these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us.
DESIGN	. this is a rather hairy case.. . one of our subclasses knows that we need to update the. archive but at the same time there are no resources. known to us that would need to be added. only the. subclass seems to know what s going on.. . this happens if jar detects that the manifest has changed . for example. the manifest is not part of any resources. because of our support for inline manifest s.. . if we invoke createemptyzip like ant 1.5.2 did . we ll loose all stuff that has been in the original. archive bugzilla report 17780 ..
DESIGN	this is deprecated use classespath in the future
DESIGN	xxx this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials.. gotta remove.
DESIGN	. set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a. target is out of date.. todo this is not yet used.. param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of. date..
DESIGN	this may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities.
DESIGN	we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error warning xxx is this correct?
DESIGN	the line below is a hack the system id must an uri but it is not cleat to get the uri of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
DESIGN	xxx what is the following doing? should it run if !javadoc4 executable ! null?
DESIGN	mac os 9 and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
DESIGN	todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter.
DESIGN	xxx we are committing combiningchar and extender here
DESIGN	. xxx failed to load the class properly.. . should we print a warning here?.
DESIGN	xxx could perhaps also call thread.stop not sure if anyone cares
DESIGN	. xxx. perhaps we shouldn t use properties for these. three options emacs mode warnings and pedantic . but include it in the javac directive?.
DESIGN	xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement other patterns ?
DESIGN	todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc. you have to provide the rules in the constructors no setters available.
DESIGN	probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in classpath
DESIGN	fix for invalid characters. if you think of more add to the list.
DESIGN	. fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or. don t know how to handle it there is no easy way to. know what idl mode would generate.. . this is supposed to make ant always recompile the. class as a file of that name should not exist..
DESIGN	check it out also ugly.
DESIGN	i can t get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here?
DESIGN	quick dirty to make nested mapped p sets work
DESIGN	xxx is this code still necessary? is there any 1.2 port? pull in .zip from packages directory
DESIGN	only the developer knows what s he is doing
DESIGN	xxx unfortunately jdk1.2 adds entryset keyset values implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later.
DESIGN	first developer could use a little help
DESIGN	xxx should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	xxx should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation?
DESIGN	since java 1.4 return normalizedpath.split workaround for java 1.2 1.3
DESIGN	hammer end inline maingtu
DESIGN	. this array really shouldn t be here.. again for historical purposes it is.. . p fixme this array should be in a private or package private. location since it could be modified by malicious code. p .
DESIGN	should move to a separate public class and have api to add listeners etc.
DESIGN	should become a single empty argument same for pr 5906
DESIGN	not very nice but will do the job
DESIGN	provide public visibility
DESIGN	not used but public so theoretically must remain for bc?
DESIGN	super.validateattributes don t want to call this method
DESIGN	xxx what is this for?
DESIGN	we keep this so we have something to delete in later tests
DESIGN	copied from concattest
DESIGN	not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions.
DESIGN	we just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up. do we need to do this? lh
DESIGN	why do we do nothing?
DESIGN	this is the new better way use classespath instead of sourcespath. the code is currently the same you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files.
DESIGN	xxx why not simply new file dir filename ?
DESIGN	this is ugly checking for the root folder.
DESIGN	todo parameterise ?? call compiler as class... dont want to fork again use classic compiler can be parameterised?
DESIGN	xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better... this is too hacky! careful.. similar code in scandir but slightly different!!
DESIGN	stolen from writemanifest
DESIGN	if the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it.. should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this. so that in case of errors we don t leave people worse off. than when we started .
DESIGN	xxx is the following really necessary? it is in the same thread group...
DESIGN	we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
DESIGN	this is the old way and is deprecated classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	for script example that modifies id ed tasks in other targets to work. very ugly the reference is replaced by runtimeconfigurable
DESIGN	don t call super.close because that reader is used on other places ...
DESIGN	report error if something weird happens...this is diagnostic.
DESIGN	sorry otherwise we will get a classcastexception because the mockcache is loaded by two different classloader ...
DESIGN	hack we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor.
DESIGN	singleton for now it may change per classloader
DESIGN	xxx shouldn t this always return false in isolated mode?
IMPLEMENTATION	to do delete the file if it is not a valid file.
IMPLEMENTATION	. this method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the code . ejbfiles code and compares them to the timestamp on the code jarfile. code . if the code jarfile code s timestamp is more recent than. each ejb file code true code is returned. otherwise code false. code is returned.. todo find a way to check the manifest file that is found by naming convention. . param ejbfiles hashtable of ejb classes and other files that will be. added to the completed jar file. param jarfile jar file which will contain all of the ejb classes and. other files. return boolean indicating whether or not the code jarfile code . is up to date.

IMPLEMENTATION	. the displayname variable stores the value of the display name element. from the standard ejb descriptor. as a future enhancement to this task . we may determine the name of the ejb jar file using this display name . but this has not be implemented yet..
IMPLEMENTATION	. an output stream that compresses into the bzip2 format without the file. header chars into another stream.. . p the compression requires large amounts of memory. thus you. should call the link close close method as soon as. possible to force tt cbzip2outputstream tt to release the. allocated memory. p . . p you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise. the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn. may cause a lower compression ratio. you can avoid unnecessary. memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger. than the size of the input. p . . p you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the. following formula p . pre . code 400k 9 blocksize code .. pre . . p to get the memory required for decompression by link. cbzip2inputstream cbzip2inputstream use p . pre . code 65k 5 blocksize code .. pre . . table width 100 border 1 . colgroup . col width 33 . col width 33 . col width 33 . colgroup . tr . th colspan 3 memory usage by blocksize th . tr tr . th align right blocksize th . th align right compression br memory usage th . th align right decompression br memory usage th . tr tr . td align right 100k td . td align right 1300k td . td align right 565k td . tr tr . td align right 200k td . td align right 2200k td . td align right 1065k td . tr tr . td align right 300k td . td align right 3100k td . td align right 1565k td . tr tr . td align right 400k td . td align right 4000k td . td align right 2065k td . tr tr . td align right 500k td . td align right 4900k td . td align right 2565k td . tr tr . td align right 600k td . td align right 5800k td . td align right 3065k td . tr tr . td align right 700k td . td align right 6700k td . td align right 3565k td . tr tr . td align right 800k td . td align right 7600k td . td align right 4065k td . tr tr . td align right 900k td . td align right 8500k td . td align right 4565k td . tr . table . . p for decompression tt cbzip2inputstream tt allocates less. memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block. p . . p instances of this class are not threadsafe. p . . p . todo update to bzip2 1.0.1. p . .
IMPLEMENTATION	xxx log an error? throw an exception?

TEST	junit3 test assertequals error junittestrunner.failures runner.getretcode fixme as of now does not report the original stacktrace. asserttrue error error.indexof thrown on purpose ! 1
TEST	the property is an id s thing either a property or a path. we need to make sure that the object was created with the given id. we don t have an adequate way of testing the actual value of the path object though...
TEST	where oh where has my test case 3 gone?
TEST	attribute names and values. while the xml spec doesn t require. preserving the order afaik some ant tests do rely on the. exact order. the following code is copied from attributeimpl.. we could also just use sax2 attributes and convert to sax1 dom. attribute nodes can also be stored in sax2 attributes . xxx under jdk 1.4 you can just use a linkedhashmap for this purpose jglick. the only exception to this order is the treatment of. refid. a number of datatypes check if refid is set. when other attributes are set. this check will not. work if the build script has the other attribute before. the refid attribute so now ant 1.7 the refid. attribute will be processed first..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we first run a dfs based sort using each root as a starting node. this creates the minimum sequence of targets to the root node s . we then do a sort on any remaining unvisited targets. this is unnecessary for doing our build but it catches circular dependencies or missing targets on the entire dependency tree not just on the targets that depend on the build target.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in vm is not very nice since it could probably hang the whole build. imho this method should be avoided and it would be best to remove it in future versions. tbd. sba
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will cause trouble in jdk 1.1 if omitted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now find available running slots for the remaining threads
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	replace the file s extension with .java
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	change the directory
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	continue on outer while loop to get another available slot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first search for the old javah class in 1.4.2 tools.jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this actually relies on the first manifest being found on the classpath probably rt.jar s being valid
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we got here all slots in use so sleep until something happens
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume older than 1.4.2 tools.jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	required attributes deprecated! use this going forward
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	are all threads finished

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	int version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	read the constant pool.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this one is here because the changes to support resourcecollections have broken magic s junittesttask. the task adds a fileset to a batchtest instance using the java api and without telling the fileset about its project instance. the original code would pass in project on the call to getdirectoryscanner which is now hidden deep into resources.iterator and not reachable.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inform ih to clear the cache

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	try a multi part netware volume length path see how it is handled
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	be sure everything has been set.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for a static suite method first even when using junit 4
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check for jdk 5 first. will not help on jdk 1.4 if only junit 4.0.jar in cp because in that case linkage of whole task will already have failed! but will help if cp has junit 3.8.2.jar junit 4.0.jar.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	methods to override
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note don t need to specify size or crc for compressed files.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not strictly necessary but probably desirable. junit 4 specific test guis will show just failures . but ant s output shows failures vs. errors . we would prefer to show failure for things that logically are.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the systemclasspath as well to include the ant jar
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finally set the property
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. necessary in the case where you add a entry that. is not compressed..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	on java 1.3 the modern falls back to classic if it is not found but on java 1.4 we just bail out early
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	output properties
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	build the command line from what we got the format as specified in the ccm.exe help

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create task ok set this task as the default one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checkstyle constantnamecheck on checkstyle visibilitymodifier on
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for sourcepath use the sourcepath value if present. otherwise default to the srcdir value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the buildfile specifies sourcepath then don t output any sourcepath.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	build the command line from what we got the format is ccm co t .. files as specified in the ccm.exe help
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default the viewpath to basedir if it is not specified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the sos class knows that the sos server needs the password flag even if there is no password so we send a

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get a random number between 0 and the number of files
DEFECT	don t try restoring the url todo wy not?
DEFECT	todo why do we clone the return value? this is the only reference to it right? so we shouldn t need a separate copy.
DEFECT	. fix bug in jvms that return true false rather than true false. from the type editor getastext method.
DEFECT	should this also fail the sample? can happen for incorrect xpath expression
DEFECT	todo why does null property have a value?
DEFECT	int contentlength httpmethod.getresponsecontentlength not visible ... todo size ouststream according to actual content length
DEFECT	this would be sensible but does not work public int hashcode return propmap.hashcode
DEFECT	fixme due to startengine being commented engine will always be null private standardjmeterengine engine
DEFECT	note these lines center the about dialog in the current window. some older swing versions have a bug in getlocationonscreen and they may not make this behave properly.
DEFECT	todo how can this be null?
DEFECT	todo display warning dialog as this can take some time
DEFECT	todo may not work on all oses?
DEFECT	. todo error counting needs to be sorted out.. . at present the statistical sampler tracks errors separately. it would make sense to move the error count here but this would. mean lots of changes.. it s also tricky maintaining the count it can t just be incremented decremented. when the success flag is set as this may be done multiple times.. the work round for now is to do the work in the statisticalsampleresult . which overrides this method.. note that some jms samplers also create samples with 1 sample count. also the transaction controller probably needs to be changed to do. proper sample and error accounting.. the purpose of this work round is to allow at least minimal support for. errors in remote statistical batch mode.. .
DEFECT	todo doesn t putting this here mark the tree as saved even though a failure may occur later?
DEFECT	todo fix so that this is only called once per test instead of at every clone perhaps save previous filename and only load if it has changed?
DEFECT	bug in above method
DEFECT	todo should we call test listeners? that might hang too ... non nls 1 default is true
DEFECT	fixme factor with httphc4impl httphc3impl just append all the parameter values and use that as the post body
DEFECT	. the sslmanager handles the keystore information for jmeter. basically it. handles all the logic for loading and initializing all the jsse parameters. and selecting the alias to authenticate against if it is available.. sslmanager will try to automatically select the client certificate for you . but if it can t make a decision it will pop open a dialog asking you for. more information.. . todo does not actually prompt. .
DEFECT	. urgent todo sort out equals and hashcode at present equal. instances can will have different hashcodes problem is when a proper. hashcode is used tests stop working e.g. listener data disappears when. switching views... this presumably means that instances currently. regarded as equal aren t really equal.. . see java.lang.object hashcode .
DEFECT	. this means that a new page will be shown before rendering is complete . however the correct location will be displayed.. attempts to use a page propertychangelistener to detect when the page. has been loaded failed to work any better. .
DEFECT	todo removes the nodes from the checkdirty map should it be done later in case some can t be removed?
DESIGN	todo turn into parameter?
DESIGN	todo improve this
DESIGN	todo do contenttype and or dataencoding belong in httpsampleresult instead?
DESIGN	todo needs more work ...
DESIGN	todo is this really necessary?
DESIGN	todo should this throw an error?
DESIGN	houston we have a problem !!
DESIGN	todo replace with proper exception
DESIGN	todo charset? todo this should really be request data but there is none
DESIGN	in milli seconds todo properties?
DESIGN	can be null not sure why
DESIGN	todo implement other non text types
DESIGN	todo this is not populated currently
DESIGN	n.b. needs to implement visualizer so that testbeangui can find the correct gui class todo remove unsharedcomponent ? probably does not make sense for a testbean.
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo use a different format here?
DESIGN	notused long longsample getsamples load each node
DESIGN	this can lead to code smell meh! do we care
DESIGN	todo is this ever used?
DESIGN	todo is this the best way to do this?
DESIGN	all keys in messages.properties are lowercase historical reasons?
DESIGN	not used protected double data null
DESIGN	todo do this more efficiently
DESIGN	todo should this use setfirst ?
DESIGN	. . a dom tree panel for to display response as tree view author a. href mailto d.maung mdl.com dave maung a . todo implement to find any nodes in the tree using treepath.. .
DESIGN	. does the system support unc paths? if so may need to fix them up. later.
DESIGN	todo should this be indeterminate? todo should this be indeterminate? non nls 1 non nls 1
DESIGN	todo should we allow null for non primitive types?
DESIGN	todo not sure this is the best method
DESIGN	todo should we call start and stop ?
DESIGN	todo is this a sensible number? non nls 1
DESIGN	todo work out how to search the xml pane
DESIGN	todo is this sensible?
DESIGN	should we return fragment as text rather than text of fragment?
DESIGN	. not clear what can cause this ? conflicting versions perhaps.
DESIGN	todo replace with proper exception return with an error
DESIGN	todo validate contenttype for reasonable types?
DESIGN	. mask values for test type todo remove either match or contains they. are mutually exckusive.
DESIGN	allow jmeter to render frames and relative images must be done after setcontenttype why?
DESIGN	todo is this used? apart from test code
DESIGN	todo should this be cleardata ?
DESIGN	. provide a description of this timer class.. . todo is this ever used? i can t remember where. remove if it isn t . todo or obtain text from bean s displayname or shortdescription.. . return the description of this timer class..
DESIGN	. provide dummy implementations to suppress download and display of. related resources frames images todo create better dummy. displays todo suppress link somehow.
DESIGN	todo should this be jtlsaver? only seems to be called by monitorhealthvisualzer
DESIGN	todo make the running indicator its own class instead of a jbutton
DESIGN	if child of transactioncontroller is a throughputcontroller and tpc does not sample its children then we will have this todo should this be at warn level ?
DESIGN	non nls 1 so it agrees with above todo perhaps should share code with time function for this... non nls 1 non nls 2 non nls 1 non nls 2
DESIGN	hack to allow automated tests to find when test has ended transient boolean testended false
DESIGN	todo could these be done earlier or just once?
DESIGN	hack to resolve modulecontrollers in non gui mode
DESIGN	add a system property so samplers can check to see if jmeter is running in nongui mode non nls 1 todo why does it create a new instance?
DESIGN	should we run a beanshell script on startup? non nls 1
DESIGN	. a little hack add each listener to the start of the list this. ensures that the thread running the show is the first listener and. can modify certain values before other listeners are called..
DESIGN	todo move this to components the only reason why it s in core is because it s used as a guinea pig by a couple of tests.
DESIGN	todo this bit of code needs to be tidied up unfortunately modulecontroller is in components not core bug 47165
DESIGN	todo this class looks a lot like argumentspanel. what exactly is the difference? could they be combined? note it seems that this class is not actually used ...
DESIGN	. ensure that the sample variables are correctly initialised for each run.. todo is this the best way to do this? should it be done elsewhere ?.
DESIGN	. add fix for deadlocks see . . see https issues.apache.org bugzilla show bug.cgi?id 48350.
DESIGN	hack to allow external control
DESIGN	todo should this also clear isdynamic rawparameters permanentresults?
DESIGN	todo should level be more than debug ?
DESIGN	this is effectively the same as saver.toxml object writer except we get to provide the dataholder don t know why there is no method for this in the xstream class
DESIGN	todo fix up for nimbus laf
DESIGN	. fixme why is searchtf not getting focus correctly after having been setvisible false once.
DESIGN	hack to get full modifier value
DESIGN	todo this method doesn t appear to be used.
DESIGN	todo why use space?
DESIGN	. todo consider removing this method and providing method wrappers instead.. this would allow the gui package to do any additional clearups if required . as has been done with cleartestplan .
DESIGN	maybe do nothing at all?
DESIGN	. notused private void initbuttonmap .
DESIGN	todo i believe the following code to the end of the method is obsolete since namepanel no longer seems to be the gui for any component
DESIGN	avoid error in ant task tests good way?
DESIGN	does not appear to be used called by mainframe seteditaddmenu but that is not called
DESIGN	. aggregates sample results for use by the statistical remote batch mode.. samples are aggregated by the key defined by getkey .. todo merge error count into parent class?.
DESIGN	todo should errors be thrown back through rmi?
DESIGN	todo perhaps save other items such as headers?
DESIGN	todo should class implement samplelistener?
DESIGN	settings readresolve sets these from the server client values as appropriate todo would be nice to make these final not 100 sure volatile is needed as not changed after creation
DESIGN	make it easier to enter a tab can use tab but that is awkward
DESIGN	todo turn into method?
DESIGN	guardedby samplestore todo perhaps use concurrenthashmap ?
DESIGN	should the samples be aggregated on thread name or thread group default ?
DESIGN	todo clazz is probably always the same as testclass
DESIGN	todo provide proper name?
DESIGN	todo does it matter that an empty line will terminate the loop? csv output files should never contain empty lines so probably not if so then need to check whether the reader is at eof
DESIGN	. todo convert to work more like upgrade.properties nameupdater.java. . special processing is carried out for the header class the string. property testelement.name is converted to header.name for example . elementprop name user agent . elementtype org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.header stringprop. name header.value mozilla 2f4.0 28compatible 3b msie 5.5 3b windows 98 29 stringprop . stringprop name testelement.name user agent stringprop . elementprop becomes elementprop name user agent . elementtype org.apache.jmeter.protocol.http.control.header stringprop. name header.value mozilla 2f4.0 28compatible 3b msie 5.5 3b windows 98 29 stringprop . stringprop name header.name user agent stringprop elementprop .
DESIGN	. these must be set before reading writing the xml. rather a hack but. saves changing all the method calls to include an extra variable.. . afaik the variables should only be accessed from one thread so no need to synchronize..
DESIGN	todo should this be restored?
DESIGN	todo not used make private?
DESIGN	todo appears to duplicate the threadname field in sampleresult
DESIGN	yuck tiffimageencoder uses error to report runtime problems
DESIGN	todo should this implement supportscustomeditor ?
DESIGN	a check just in case
DESIGN	not used as the testresult element is generated by the resultcollector class
DESIGN	. check if a string is a valid jmeter expression .. p . the current implementation is very basic it just accepts any string. containing as a valid expression. todo improve but keep returning. true for ..
DESIGN	todo use or remove
DESIGN	i guess this can happen as a result of a bad file read? in this case it would be better to replace the incorrect value with anything valid e.g. the default value for the property. but for the time being i just prefer to be aware of any problems occuring here most likely programming errors so i ll bail out. ms note can t bail out newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults. also when loading previous versions of jmeter test scripts some values may not be right and should get default values ms todo review this and possibly change to
DESIGN	todo does not work yet need to determine the sample type
DESIGN	programming error bail out.
DESIGN	temporary fix to allow default protocol to be changed
DESIGN	todo consider using private logs for each derived class
DESIGN	does not appear to be used yet
DESIGN	todo temporary hack to avoid unnecessary bug reports for subclasses
DESIGN	todo yet another ambiguous name does it need changing? see also clearable jmeterguicomponent
DESIGN	todo is this silent exception intended
DESIGN	. the following variables are set by standardjmeterengine.. this is done before start is called so the values will be published to the thread safely. todo consider passing them to the constructor so that they can be made final. to avoid adding lots of parameters perhaps have a parameter wrapper object..
DESIGN	todo should this set the thread names for all the subsamples? might be more efficient than fetching the name elsewehere
DESIGN	. setting samplingstarted before the contollers are initialised allows. them to access the running values of functions and variables however. it does not seem to help with the listeners .
DESIGN	todo remove this useless entry parameter
DESIGN	surely this is always null in the constructor?
DESIGN	todo why not use the super class value?
DESIGN	todo does not appear to be called directly
DESIGN	. custom trustmanager ignores all certificate errors. . todo implement conditional checking and logging. . derived from authsslx509trustmanager in httpclient contrib directory .
DESIGN	maps to contain page and form encodings todo do these really need to be shared between all proxy instances?
DESIGN	note source and line arguments are nonsense in a call . any way to make these arguments sensible?
DESIGN	is it an exception wrapped in a javascriptexception?
DESIGN	todo why empty block ?
DESIGN	todo perhaps this should be a fatal error?
DESIGN	clone will produce correct type todo but why do we need to clone the list?
DESIGN	todo only called by userparameterxmlparser.getxmlparameters which is a deprecated class
DESIGN	todo probably not needed
DESIGN	todo needs to be synch? probably not changed after threads have started jmeter home directory excludes trailing separator jmeter bin directory excludes trailing separator
DESIGN	hack bsh 2.0b5.jar bshscriptengine implements compilable but throws java.lang.error unimplemented
DESIGN	todo only clear the relevant entry if possible...
DESIGN	todo what is this for?
DESIGN	todo is sync really needed?
DESIGN	todo is this correct?
DESIGN	todo cpercent is the same as cmedian here why? and why pass it to distributionline ?
DESIGN	todo should equals and hashcode depend on field other than count?
DESIGN	todo does this method need to be public? it isn t currently called outside of this class.
DESIGN	todo should the method signature of this method be changed to match the super implementation using a testelement parameter instead of abstractlistenerelement ? this would require an instanceof check before adding the listener below but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for sub classes the java rules dealing with this situation aren t always intuitive and a subclass may think it is calling this version of the method when it is really calling the superclass version instead.
DESIGN	todo should this method be synchronized ? all other function execute are
DESIGN	todo should the engine be static?
DESIGN	n.b. commons io ioutils has equivalent methods these were added before io was included todo perhaps deprecate these in favour of commons io?
DESIGN	todo should this be getmin ?
DESIGN	. fix bug d arg1 arg2 was causing parse error however. define arg1 arg2 is ok this seems to be because the parser. skips the terminator for the long options but was not doing. so for the short options..
DESIGN	todo improve the error handling
DESIGN	. add logtargets to root logger. fixme what s the clean way to add a logtarget afterwards ?. param logtargets logtarget array.
DESIGN	hack to reduce the need to load every class in non gui mode which only needs functions todo perhaps use bcel to scan class files instead? class name should contain this string class name should not contain this string
DESIGN	. todo exact ordering is only required for some tests change the. comparison to do a set compare where necessary..
DESIGN	todo improve this check
DESIGN	todo could this be return?
DESIGN	todo field always true what for ?
DESIGN	very wrong.
DESIGN	todo should this be a failure?
DESIGN	. wrapper to convert a junit4 class into a testcase. . todo work out how to convert junit4 assertions so they are treated as failures rather than errors.
DESIGN	method is broken anyway
DESIGN	todo should really return most specific i.e. longest match.
DESIGN	todo should this be done for embedded usage? note the element is a configtestelement when used standalone so we cannot use ftpsampler access methods
DESIGN	todo replace all this url2 mess with a proper method areequivalent url1 url2 that would also ignore case in protocol and host names etc. use that method in the cookiemanager too.
DESIGN	todo is this possible?
DESIGN	. holder for storing cache details.. perhaps add original response later?.
DESIGN	todo not used by gui
DESIGN	not currently used
DESIGN	todo correct url?
DESIGN	note the handling of simple vs. double quotes could be formally more accurate but i can t imagine a session id containing either so we should be ok. the whole set of expressions is a quick hack anyway so who cares.
DESIGN	. todo improve string version to better match browser behaviour? e.g.. do browsers regard http host and http host 80 as the same? if. so it would be better to reflect this in the string.
DESIGN	code also allows for lf only not sure why perhaps because the test code uses it?
DESIGN	todo find a way to avoid the cost of creating a string here probably a new patternmatcherinput working on a byte would do better.
DESIGN	todo should setbaseforscript be called here rather than above?
DESIGN	java 1.6.0 22 no longer allows content length to be set so don t check it. see http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do?bug id 6996110 todo any point in checking the other headers?
DESIGN	sampleevent is not passed jmetervariables because they don t make sense for proxy recording todo is this the correct threadgroup name?
DESIGN	todo needs cleaning up
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo should this be a variable?
DESIGN	hack to skip processing
DESIGN	todo replace repeated substr above and below with more efficient method.
DESIGN	todo perhaps make more specific than this? no point parsing anything else e.g. gif ...
DESIGN	won t work writeerrortoclient httpreplyhdr.forminternalerror generate result if nec. and populate it hack to skip processing
DESIGN	todo should this be done when the client is created? if so then the details need to be added as part of httpclientkey
DESIGN	hack
DESIGN	todo hack to be removed later
DESIGN	could we drop the sync here?
DESIGN	todo should lf only eol be allowed?
DESIGN	dircontext dc todo perhaps return this?
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo change to use url version? will this affect test plans?
DESIGN	todo specify collection type without breaking callers
DESIGN	todo can this eever happen?
DESIGN	all form parameter always have text plain as mime type todo make this a parameter?
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo can this be obtained from the file somehow?
DESIGN	does not appear to be used
DESIGN	notused guipackage guipack
DESIGN	todo is null correct?
DESIGN	todo how to handle thread stopped here
DESIGN	slight hack we need to ensure the testclass is not reset by the previous call
DESIGN	todo should this be called if basedir null?
DESIGN	todo could be converted to generic class?
DESIGN	todo does not appear to be used
DESIGN	todo not used?
DESIGN	todo make static?
DESIGN	hack to allow entire url to be provided in host field
DESIGN	todo should this be ok ? assertequals contentencoding s.getcontentencoding check arguments we should have one argument with the value equal to the post body
DESIGN	todo downcase upper case non final variables
DESIGN	todo belongs elsewhere
DESIGN	todo can this happen?
DESIGN	todo needed here because currently done on sample completion in jmeterthread but that only catches top level samples.
DESIGN	todo this is a bit fragile
DESIGN	todo is this correct? if this is not the first file we can t write its header now for simplicity we always save it even if there is only one file
DESIGN	todo should this return something else?
DESIGN	don t allow override of content length this helps with soapsampler hack too todo what other headers are not allowed?
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo should this be variable?
DESIGN	may be replaced later
DESIGN	todo do we need to add a charset for the file contents? non nls 1
DESIGN	todo merge put and post methods as far as possible. e.g. post checks for multipart form files and if not invokes senddata httpentityenclosingrequestbase
DESIGN	get the content length it tells us how much data to read todo maybe support chunked encoding then we cannot rely on content length
DESIGN	todo is this the correct default?
DESIGN	todo should we allow mimetype only?
DESIGN	. todo should these fields be public?. they don t appear to be used externally.. . also are they any different from httpconstants.get etc. ?. in some cases they seem to be used as the method name from the tomcat log.. however the rmethod field is used as the value for httpsamplerbase.method . for which httpconstants is most approriate..
DESIGN	notused org.apache.jmeter.monitor.model.status st todo charset?
DESIGN	remember to change this when the class changes ...
DESIGN	todo find out how to retrieve these from the script at present the script has to use sampleresult methods to set them. non nls 1 non nls 1
DESIGN	todo process warnings? set code and message to success?
DESIGN	todo should the encoding be configurable? non nls 1
DESIGN	non nls 1 todo probably wrong
DESIGN	todo method with 0 reference really useful ?
DESIGN	maybe we should consider creating a global cache for the random files to make jmeter more efficient.
DESIGN	. jmetertreenode and testbeangui are special gui classes and. aren t intended to be added to menus. . todo find a better way of checking this.
DESIGN	menubar related methods todo do we really need to have all these menubar methods duplicated here? perhaps we can make the menu bar accessible through guipackage?
DESIGN	should we use java.naming.security. principal credentials to create the queueconnection?
DESIGN	todo set different status if not enough messages found?
DESIGN	todo fix this when there is a real implementation
DESIGN	allow serializable test to work todo is the serializable test necessary now that jmetertreenode is no longer a gui component?
DESIGN	. fixme broken code.
DESIGN	notused private string chosenfile
DESIGN	. find all beans out there and check their resource property files check. that non default property files don t have any extra keys. check all. necessary properties are defined at least in the default property file . except for beans whose name contains experimental or alpha . . . todo check property files don t have duplicate keys is this important . .
DESIGN	this could perhaps be a variable name
DESIGN	results.setresponsecode ??? todo what code should be set here?
DESIGN	should we add the separator?
DESIGN	todo should we skip processing here?
DESIGN	todo add some real tests now that split has been removed
DESIGN	not used transient protected threadgroup threadgroup null anyway was this supposed to be the class from java.lang or jmeter.threads?
DESIGN	all the others could be private too?
DESIGN	todo can this ever happen?
DESIGN	todo fetch list of languages from a file? n.b. changes to language list need to be reflected in resources packagetest.java
DESIGN	todo move to utils class jmeterutils?
DESIGN	todo do we need to implement any kind of connection pooling? if so which connections should be shared? should threads share connections to the same destination? what about cross thread sharing?
DESIGN	todo ought to be a filechooser ...
DESIGN	set the content type todo needed? string multipartcontenttype multipart.getcontenttype .getvalue post.setheader header content type multipartcontenttype
DESIGN	. todo this assumes that the redirected response will always immediately follow the original response.. this may not always be true.. is there a better way to do this?.
DESIGN	todo is it the best way ? https issues.apache.org bugzilla show bug.cgi?id 55634
DESIGN	keep the unexpanded path todo allow directories to end with .jar by removing this check?
DESIGN	todo the above works in the current situation but it s just a hack. how to get each editor to report whether it wants to grow bigger? whether the property label should be at the left or at the top of the editor? ...?
DESIGN	hack save the package for any transaction controllers
DESIGN	how many classes can we assign from? todo there must be a nicer way...
DESIGN	should the testbean be hidden?
DESIGN	todo why lower case? ok to use the default locale?
DESIGN	a hack to make user defined variables in the testplan element more dynamic
DESIGN	hack force the controller to load its tree
DESIGN	it might be useful also to make this available in the request tab for when posting json.
DESIGN	should header be saved with the data? non nls 1
DESIGN	showing large strings can be very costly so we will avoid doing so if the response data is larger than 200k. todo instead we could delay doing the result.settext call until the user chooses the response data tab. plus we could warn the user if this happens and revert the choice if he doesn t confirm he s ready to wait.
DESIGN	n.b. needs to implement visualizer so that testbeangui can find the correct gui class
DESIGN	todo strings should be resources
DESIGN	result.seterror true todo is this the correct strategy? throw exception allow assertion to pass
DESIGN	why does this not call guiinstance.cleartestplan ? is there a reason for not clearing everything?
DESIGN	todo move to jorphanutils?
DESIGN	notused yet private jtextfield filename
DESIGN	maybe move to vector if mt problems occur
DESIGN	todo should this just call super ?
DOCUMENTATION	todo document the reason for this
DOCUMENTATION	todo can t see anything in spec
IMPLEMENTATION	todo somehow show progress
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support multiple signers
IMPLEMENTATION	todo fetch this once as per vars above?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add and delete not currently supported non nls 1
IMPLEMENTATION	fix path to allow the use of unc urls
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should this use setdone ? todo should this use setfirst ?
IMPLEMENTATION	set the overall status for the transaction sample todo improve e.g. by adding counts to the sampleresult class
IMPLEMENTATION	should we exit at end of the test? only applies to server because host is non null
IMPLEMENTATION	. have we reached the reporting boundary?. need to allow for a margin of error otherwise can miss the slot.. also need to check we ve not hit the window already.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo save hostname save sample type plain or http
IMPLEMENTATION	remind convert arg list vectors here?
IMPLEMENTATION	it is chunked transfer encoding which we do not really support yet. so we just read without blocking because we do not know when to stop reading so we cannot block todo propery implement support for chunked transfer i.e. to know when we have read the whole request and therefore allow the reading to block
IMPLEMENTATION	allow the mimetype of the file to control the content type this is not obvious in gui if you are not uploading any files but just sending the content of nameless parameters todo needs a multiple file upload scenerio
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle filenames
IMPLEMENTATION	not yet handled
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should check that error has been logged...
IMPLEMENTATION	don t allow override of content length todo what other headers are not allowed?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ? perhaps note connection so it can be disconnected at end of test?
TEST	todo enable some proper tests!!
TEST	todo make these separate tests?
TEST	todo need a lot more tests
TEST	todo add tests for savegraphics
TEST	todo improve this test non nls 1 non nls 2 missing variable name
TEST	todo add tests for reportsavegraphics
TEST	todo should this be done even if not a full test plan? and what if load fails?
TEST	todo these assertions should be separate tests
TEST	todo need more tests
TEST	todo some more invalid sequence tests needed
TEST	. todo add tests to check for name clash long option abbreviations. match shortest unique abbreviation .

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. implementation notes . . all of the methods in this class are currently read only. if update. methods are included in the future they should be defined so that a. single instance of javasamplercontext can be associated with each thread.. therefore no synchronization should be needed. the same instance should. be used for the call to setuptest all calls to runtest and the call to. teardowntest..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note that samplestarted and samplestopped is not made to appear in synch with sampleoccured when replaying held samples. for now this is not critical since samplestarted and samplestopped is not used but it may become an issue in the future. then these events must also be stored so that replay of all events may occur and in the right order. each stored event must then be tagged with something that lets you distinguish between occured started and ended.

DEFECT	todo only occurrence of isconcurrent in uml 2.1.1 is in index it s not on the page that is indexed

DEFECT	strange but the link.getconnection . returns a collection not a list!. this is a bug compared to the uml standard imho mvw .. hence the linkend is added to the end instead...
DEFECT	todo synchronized is required here as there can be some concurrent modification problems when drawing a call message and having that automatically draw the reply. maybe fixing the todo below will resolve this and the synch can go.

DEFECT	todo this whole block can be deleted when issue 6266 is resolved
DEFECT	dirty fix for issue 1758 needs to be amended. when we start supporting parameters .
DEFECT	todo this does not work! mvw . model.getfacade .setbody expr guard . model.getfacade .setexpression g expr

DEFECT	warning the outputstream version of this doesn t work! tfm
DEFECT	else if the y coordinate is outside of the classifier role we fix the y in the max y of the classifier role. fixme we should increase the height of the classifier role don t???

DEFECT	todo not implemented by euml
DEFECT	todo this only works if the item is visible all its parents are expanded getexpandeddescendants makevisible
DEFECT	this will have problems if the smallest possible data segment is smaller than the size of the buffer needed for regex matching
DEFECT	todo why is this throwing a generic runtime exception?!?!
DEFECT	disabled since it gives various problems e.g. the toolbar icons. get too wide. also the default does not give the new java 5.0 looks.. component tree projectbrowser.getinstance . swingutilities.updatecomponenttreeui swingutilities.getrootpane tree .
DEFECT	if this is a feature get the owner of that feature todo does anything actually make use of this? it can cause unexpected behaviour.
DEFECT	todo this error needs to be reported!
DEFECT	todo not in uml 2
DEFECT	todo we should be giving the user more direct feedback
DEFECT	todo this should be using internalgetallrealizedinterfaces
DEFECT	many many of these events .. this slows things down
DEFECT	todo this doesn t perform well enough with large models to have it enabled by default. if the performance can t be improved perhaps we can introduce a manual find in explorer tree action. selectall targets
DEFECT	todo this is never executed as ludos di work was never finished.
DEFECT	todo when the attribute isn t in the diagram for exemple select attribut by explorer then the refresh isn t auto we had to click !!
DEFECT	todo this is probably an undesirable side effect unless the user confirms it. placing an element on a second diagram is going to potentially change its namespace. tfm 20061208
DEFECT	todo the below is not strictly correct but should cover the case we deal with. using a real xml parser would be better. look for xml document has just a single root element

DEFECT	todo make setbounds calcbounds and updatebounds consistent
DEFECT	set the child components to the heights in the array list calculating the height of any proportional component on the fly. fixme this assumes that the jlabel and the component it labels have been added to the parent component consecutively.
DEFECT	. a mode to interpret user input while creating a permission edge.. the permission can connect any model elements including those represented. by edges as well as nodes.. p . todo in uml 2.x permission becomes packageimport and the class hierarchy. has changed so that it is no longer a subtype of dependency so this may. need to be refactored to work correctly..
DEFECT	todo considering all delete events to be valid like below is going to cause lots of unecessary work and some problems
DEFECT	todo the size of text figs which is what we care about most isn t computed correctly by gef. if we got ambitious we could recompute a proper size ourselves.
DEFECT	. a critic to detect when a classifier has to many operations . p . . todo exclude getter and setter operations from count.
DEFECT	todo why isn t this calculation for location working?
DEFECT	todo this code doesn t look like it will get reached because any abstraction realization is going to take the isaabstraction leg of the if before it gets to this more general case. tfm 20080508
DEFECT	todo this should probably only update the project when the user presses return or focus is lost
DEFECT	the next line does not work
DEFECT	todo if actioncopy is no longer a singleton how shall this work?
DEFECT	todo huge side effect. hoist out of parse tfm let s load the project

DESIGN	this is wrongly called with a null handle as a workaround we return an empty collection
DESIGN	todo not navigable this direction? tfm
DESIGN	todo this doesn t look right review tfm
DESIGN	. return the statemachine. . todo if this method is called by any of the figs it will introduce. a dependency cycle. it would be much better if they could just. use link org.argouml.uml.diagram.argodiagram getowner which does. the same thing..
DESIGN	todo need to clean up objecttoid can we do it based on modelelement delete notifications?
DESIGN	. the constructor.. todo why does this method not handle all settings. key default shadow width is missing ?.
DESIGN	todo performance critical method

DESIGN	todo optimize for root model case? tfm
DESIGN	todo do we really need to do this? carried over from old behavior
DESIGN	todo elementownership is not in modelsubsys!!
DESIGN	todo this seems like a brute force workaround and a very indirect one at that . it appears to be needed though until we fix the problem properly. tfm 20070904

DESIGN	todo better if we wrap in a profileexception and throw that
DESIGN	create our bandbuffer which is just a small slice of the image todo we used a fixed height buffer now but we could be smarter and compute a height which would fit in some memory budget allowing us to use taller buffers with narrower images minimizing the overhead of multiple rendering passes
DESIGN	todo support iterate declarator
DESIGN	. return returns the default stereotype view. todo enumeration here?.
DESIGN	todo how about figassociationclass?
DESIGN	todo this shouldn t depend on the current project but for now just make sure it s defined and that we have an undo manager
DESIGN	. remove this diagram from existence.. . todo move to gef.
DESIGN	todo this needs to be managing undo on a per project basis instead of using gef s global undo manager
DESIGN	. this class gives critics access to parts of the uml model of the. design. it defines a gen function that returns the children . of any given part of the uml model. basically it goes from. project to models to modelelements. argo s critic agency uses. this to apply critics where appropriate.. . todo this thinks it knows all the composition associations of the. the uml metamodel but it is a incomplete and b not updated for. uml 1.4. this should be done using information from the metamodel. rather than hardwired code. tfm 20070205. . see org.argouml.cognitive.agency. see org.argouml.cognitive.designer. author jrobbins.

DESIGN	our superclass no longer has this method so perhaps this whole thing should be removed? tfm super.updatelisteners newowner
DESIGN	todo this is actually a hack! some diagram types like the statechart diagrams access the current diagram to get some info. this might cause problems if there s another statechart diagram active so i remove the current project before loading the new one.
DESIGN	todo handle multiple top level packages
DESIGN	the following is specifically for realizations todo correction in gef it should use interfacerealization not abstraction
DESIGN	todo in uml 2.x a tagdefinition has become a property on a stereotype anything that uses this will probably need to be reviewed changed. just return property for now.
DESIGN	language must be unique todo do it in the model if don t use the dialog and change the first

DESIGN	todo maybe separate name
DESIGN	todo here we should e.g. show the user a message that. the loaded project was using a notation that is not. currently available and a fall back on the default notation. was done. maybe this can be implemented in the. persistencemanager?
DESIGN	. todo this is the same as in parent remove?. see org.argouml.uml.diagram.ui.fignodemodelelement updatebounds .

DESIGN	hack for to do items only should check isleaf node but that includes empty folders. really i need alwaysleaf node .
DESIGN	todo why was this next line in the code so long?
DESIGN	this method has insufficient information to call buildextensionpoint. thus we ll need to create one and pray that whomever called us knows what kind of mess they got.

DESIGN	. todo this class should be moved to package. org.argouml.uml.ui.behavior.common behavior..
DESIGN	if is a classifier role it must return the sent messages. in other cases returns an empty list. todo must be the incoming messages or the sent ones?
DESIGN	. initialize the argouml application version so that. link applicationversion getversion doesn t return null.. . throws exception if something goes wrong.... todo move this to an helper class..

DESIGN	todo silently ignore instead? return false
DESIGN	. find the icon for a given model element.. . return the icon or code null code if there is no icon.. param value the model element.. . todo this should not use string matching on classnames to do this. since this means that we have knowledge about how the model. elements are implemented outside of the model component..
DESIGN	initialze gef s version of the loader too todo we should probably be passing icons that we loaded ourselves but there doesn t seem to be a way to do that with gef tfm

DESIGN	. returns the root package.. . return the package which is the root. deprecated for 0.25.4 by tfmorris use link getroots to. get packages model elements which are at the top level.. p . todo we probably need a getdefaultnamespace method or. something similar to replace some uses of this..
DESIGN	. updates the top level modelelements for all projects. in uml2 each. model knows it s root elements so this could make setroots ... . obsolete. e.g. applying a stereotype in uml2 adds a new root.. . todo this is redundant with setroots getroots. there are already too. many ways this stuff is managed without adding an additional one.. all current model subsystem implementations know their top level. elements. responsibility can be moved to the model subsystem but. let s choose one way of managing this..
DESIGN	. a datastructure for settings for a project. p . . most getters return a string since they are used by argo.tee .. this is also the reason all these attributes. are not part of a map or something. p . . todo the header comment is currently not used this function. is not completely implemented yet. how do we store this in the project?. where should the user enter his header comment? see issue 4813.. . author michiel.
DESIGN	. notation settings value object. stores settings which control how text is. rendered on diagrams.. p . todo this needs to go on a diet. it s used everywhere so is performance. sensitive. the current set of settings is the union of all those found in the. legacy code but it s not clear that all of them are actually used.. . author tom morris tfmorris gmail.com .

DESIGN	todo end up with multiple models here
DESIGN	we re deleting the last diagram so lets create a new one todo once we go mdi we won t need this.
DESIGN	. create a notation settings value object with all default values.. p . todo this class only has partial undo support basically just those. members that had it as part of a previous implementation ..
DESIGN	this code was copied from actionbooleantaggedvalue

DESIGN	save the .argo entry todo cyclic dependency with persistencemanager move persistencemanager..getprojectbasename someplace else
DESIGN	if c2 is empty then we re done or there is a cycle in the message graph which would be bad if c2 has more than one element then the model is crappy but we ll just use one of them anyway
DESIGN	. utility method to encode a string in a way that allows it to be. saved properly in an xml file and regained filtering out any noice. that an xml framework might have seen fit to add.. . todo why are we doing this ourselves? surely encoding information. for xml serialization is a well known task tfm. i have never understood why this is being done. i think we should remove. any usage bob. . param str the string to encode.. return the encoded string..
DESIGN	hence a less elegant workaround that works
DESIGN	this should probably be inside xmireader.parse but there is another place in this source where xmireader is used but it appears to be the nsuml xmireader. when argo xmireader is used consistently it can be responsible for loading the listener. until then do it here.
DESIGN	. a critic to suggest using the facade stereotype. p . . todo at the moment only a dummy implementation . see issue 3093..

DESIGN	todo use stylesheet to convert or wait till we use fig factories in diagram subsystem. what is the last version that used fignote?
DESIGN	todo move to diagram subsystem?
DESIGN	. set the fig style attributes.. p . . todo this should move into the render factories as described in issue. 859.. . param fig the fig to style.. param attributemap a map of name value pairs.
DESIGN	todo without this we fail to draw e.g. a class.. but is this a good solution? . why is the layer not set in the constructor?
DESIGN	todo we really want to be able replace the initial content handler which is passed to sax but we can t do this without cloning a whole bunch of code because it s private in the super class.
DESIGN	if no fig was created by the code above then we must go look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse by now. fig object rectangle diagramsettings all of these constructors should have been deprecated at least and replaced with the new signature. this is here for paranoia only until all figs have been reviewed.
DESIGN	a fignodemodelelement with no owner should match here todo this is a temporary solution due to figpool extending fignodemodelelement when in fact it should not do so.
DESIGN	. translate the visibility flag of a fig to the pgml visibility attribute. value.. the pgml values are 0 hidden and 1 shown.. if not specified then 1 is the default so we return null for this to. prevent redundent data being written to pgml.. todo remove on gef release after 0.11.9 as it will be provided there.. . param f the fig. return 0 hidden null shown.
DESIGN	. the file persister for the uml model.. todo this is empty. what is its purpose? tfm. author bob tarling.
DESIGN	. todo not sure we need to do this but just to be safe for now..
DESIGN	. open a zipinputstream to the first file found with a given extension.. . todo remove since this is a duplicate of zipfilepersister method. when we have refactored the persister subsystem.. . param url. the url of the zip file.. param ext. the required extension.. return the zip stream positioned at the required location.. throws ioexception. if there is a problem opening the file..
DESIGN	. todo this doesn t need a full profilereference since it uses the. reader handed in the constructor. it doesn t make much sense to make. its callers init the path to some name which it doesn t need.... . author luis sergio oliveira euluis .
DESIGN	todo what does the magic number 6000 represent here? put it in an explanatory literal! tfm 20071205
DESIGN	todo seems like overkill to load the model just to get the display name but that s where it s stored currently tfm
DESIGN	todo this appears unused. if it s needed the model api should be enhanced to provide a method that does this directly.
DESIGN	todo is this critics embedded in comments actually used by anyone?
DESIGN	todo all this profile loading handling needs to move someplace in model subsystem probably
DESIGN	todo this profile isn t used anymore see getmodel
DESIGN	todo this is an absurdly long method! break it up.
DESIGN	todo we need a specific exception type here.
DESIGN	todo this code is cloned over and over again! tfm
DESIGN	. settings dialog tab panel for layout options. p . . todo this class contains a lot of references to org.argouml.uml.ui.. it would probably be better to move it there.. . todo this class breaks too many dependency limitations. . and it is not used anywhere. so i mvw disabled its functionality. . . author linus tolke.
DESIGN	. todo we could also support other flavors here . e.g. image then you can drag modelelements directly into. your wordprocessor to be inserted as an image ..
DESIGN	todo why isn t this done in save?
DESIGN	todo the following handling of multiselection is just a local solution for the line color better find a more general solution i don t know if it s undoable this way thn
DESIGN	todo the following handling of multiselection is just a local solution for the fill color better find a more general solution i don t know if it s undoable this way thn
DESIGN	todo we need to get the model extent and package? associated with the current diagram so that we can create the new element in the right place.
DESIGN	. the dialog that allows the user to go to any diagram in the project. by doubleclicking on it. p . . this dialog is not modal and can stay open while the user. is working on the model. it is even possible to open multiple. of these dialogs although the purpose of such useraction eludes me. p . . todo this dialog should have multiple tabs named help diagram . classifier statevertex etc. which would allow the user to go to other. things than diagrams.. . author mvw. .
DESIGN	todo some parts of argouml have preliminary support for multiple. details panels but we currently only support. the default south bottom panel.
DESIGN	todo check that this is correct
DESIGN	. flag to indicate if we are the main application. or being integrated in another top level application such. as eclipse via the argoeclipse plugin .. todo this is a temporary measure until projectbrowser. can be refactored more appropriately. tfm.
DESIGN	todo bob says tabs that listen for target changes should register themselves not expect detailspane to listen and pass on the event. otherwise these tabs always rely on detailspane. tabtodotarget and tabprops currently listen directly.
DESIGN	. try to save the project.. param overwrite if true then we overwrite without asking. param file the file to save to. param pmw the progressmonitor to be updated . return true if successful. . todo separate this into a swing specific class tfm. deprecated in 0.29.1 by bob tarling use trysavewithprogressmonitor.

DESIGN	todo bob says we re looking at focus change to flag the start of an interaction. this is to detect when focus is gained in a prop panel field on the assumption editing of that field is about to start. not a good assumption. we need to see if we can get rid of this.
DESIGN	. this class represents a pool of swimlanes for activity diagrams. this is. exists only to act as the gef style encloser. other nodes in the same. must be placed entirely within or outside the boundaries of this fig. but cannot intersect with the boundary. p . todo there is no actual model element being represented here so we are. inheriting a lot of behaviour from fignodemodelelement that we don t want.. we require to split fignodemodelelement to separate the code that requires. a model element owner. see issue ... p . remark mvw why not give it an owner instead? the activitygraph . is the obvious candidate or maybe the top state.. . author mkl.
DESIGN	. manages a progressmonitor dialog.. . note users of this class should use the type of the interface. link org.argouml.taskmgmt.progressmonitor wherever possible to. maintain gui independence.. . author andrea nironi tigris.org. . todo bob says i don t like the naming of this class. its confusing that. its called ...window and yet it is not a window. lets rename once we have. it hidden..

DESIGN	todo can we move this knowledge behind model facade rather than have a condition here?
DESIGN	. a command to set selected figs to their minimum size. p . despite its name really the minimum size is selected here! p . . todo rename this class.. . author markus klink.
DESIGN	. this fig is never placed on a diagram. it is only used by the call. renderer so that pick list items look like diagram figs.. todo this fig does not represent a model element and so it. should not extend fignodemodelelement. we should split. fignodemodelelement in two one for base functionality for all nodes. and one that is truly for model elements..
DESIGN	todo why is this code even getting called for a figgeneralization?
DESIGN	. class to manage project related actions which need to be or historically. have been managed as singletons.. . todo it s unclear to me whether all of these actually have to be managed as. singletons but for now i ve just moved them from projectbrowser as is. tfm. . author tom morris.
DESIGN	todo move to different class?
DESIGN	i hate this so much even before i start writing it. re initialising a global in a place where no one will see it just feels wrong. oh well here goes.
DESIGN	todo this shouldn t know the internal form of type names but i m not sure what gef s predicatetype does so i m fixing it here tfm
DESIGN	kludge required by gef s use of hashmap in the api todo this can be removed if they ever fix gef to use maps
DESIGN	critique menu todo this dependency should be inverted with the critics subsystem registering its desired shortcuts with us tfm

DESIGN	. forwards this event to the tree model.. . param element the modelelement to be changed. . todo this shouldn t be public. components desiring to. inform the explorer of changes should send events..
DESIGN	todo delete should be available on any combination of model elements and diagrams. todo shouldn t be creating a new instance here. we should hold the delete action in some central place.
DESIGN	. adds the entry to the mru list.. . param filename. of the project. . todo this should listen for file save events rather than being called. directly tfm..
DESIGN	todo make sure this shouldn t go into a previous condition tml
DESIGN	todo shouldn t be creating a new instance here. we should hold the delete action in some central place.
DESIGN	. the tree structure has changed significantly.. inform the associated tree model.. . todo this shouldn t be public. components desiring to. inform the explorer of changes should send events.. deprecated by mvw in v0.25.4. use events instead..
DESIGN	todo we really only care about events which affect things that are visible in the current perspective view . this could be tailored to cut down on event traffic. tfm 20060410
DESIGN	. the singleton instance.. . todo why is this a singleton? wouldn t it be better to have exactly. one for every explorer?.
DESIGN	todo we need a factory pattern for goxxx classes that can determine if they are required
DESIGN	todo can this be made more restrictive? do we care about any attributes other than name? tfm
DESIGN	this is carried over from previous implementation not sure why we don t want contents of package tfm 20060214
DESIGN	todo any namespace can contain other elements. why don t we allow this? tfm
DESIGN	todo really should be element modelelement but we don t have a type which is portable for this
DESIGN	todo this method can be replaced by getclass .getsimplename when argo drops support for java versions 1.5
DESIGN	. see org.argouml.cognitive.critic setheadline java.lang.string . . set up the locale specific text for the critic headline. the one liner that appears in the to do pane . and the critic description the detailed explanation that. appears in the to do tab of the details pane .. . mvw maybe we can make it part of the constructor cruml ?. . fixme why override if nobody uses?.
DESIGN	. set the threshold.. . todo should this be protected?. . param threshold the threshold to compare to..
DESIGN	todo split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly in this class.
DESIGN	todo do we need this generalization is not a named element
DESIGN	these may not actually make any difference at present the code behind addtrigger needs more work .
DESIGN	. find all the figs that visualise the given model element in. this layer or null if there is none.. . todo once gef includes this same method in diagram then this can go. . see org.tigris.gef.base.diagram presentationsfor java.lang.object .
DESIGN	todo this uses a last one wins algorithm for registration we should warn if a factory is being overwritten.
DESIGN	. gets font name. if it doesn t exist in configuration it creates new. entries in configuration for appearance.. . todo why create in a getter?. . return the name of the configured font.
DESIGN	todo what is this trying to do? it s never going to get called tfm really dirty hack to remove unwanted listeners
DESIGN	todo this shouldn t be referencing the current project. instead the appropriate undomanager should have already been retrieved from the correct project.
DESIGN	todo we should be given an undo manager to use rather than looking for a global one
DESIGN	todo replace the next deprecated call. this case is complicated . by the use of parameters. all other figs work differently.
DESIGN	. class to display graphics for a uml choice state in a diagram the circle.. . todo this should really be renamed figchoicestate. it s the. last vestige of the uml 1.3 name.. . author pepargouml.
DESIGN	todo what is this needed for? tfm
DESIGN	the next 4 lines fix the 2nd half of issue 5638.. is there no better way?
DESIGN	. return a list of gravity points around circle which is enclosed. in the bounding box. convenience method for use by figinitialstate. and figfinalstate.. todo as this method is not required by all sub classes . it would seem sensible to extend figstatevertex with figcirclevertex. and only have the relevant concrete figs extend that and gain this. functionality.. return a list of points.
DESIGN	. to resize only when a new concurrent region is added . changing the height.. todo probably shouldn t. exist as this class should be listening for added concurrent regions. and call this internally itself.. . param h the new height.
DESIGN	todo aren t our items always strings? tfm 20100917
DESIGN	. actually instanciate the netnode and fignode objects and. set the global next mode to modeplace. todo should call super reduce code volume!. . see org.tigris.gef.graph.graphfactory makenode .
DESIGN	todo this logic may well be worth moving into the model component. provide a similar grid to the connectionsgrid
DESIGN	todo ? if this class listen the model it will be able to change in live as it is done in the figs diagram
DESIGN	todo redo it curbody should be as long as curlanguage button
DESIGN	todo needs to be tidied up after stable release. graph model should be created in constructor
DESIGN	. when we change the type we need to create a new initial value. and. to display the panel. . todo if we select the same type that the current do nothing..
DESIGN	todo we definitely don t want to react to addition and removal of transitions. can t we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener.
DESIGN	. the target model element. in uml1.x this is the element that owns the expression.. in uml2.x this is the expression itself. todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses. should be considered..
DESIGN	. field todo textarea or textfield.
DESIGN	. todo use it notify set to true to forward events to model. only one of. language and body fields should have this set to true..
DESIGN	todo if this is an ordered list then you have to. add in the right location!
DESIGN	todo this is a redundant invocation
DESIGN	get all classifiers in our model todo we need the property panels to have some reference to the project they belong to instead of using deprecated functionality
DESIGN	. todo copied from umldiagramrenderer.. . get the fignode from the given layer that represents the given. model element.. the fignode portion of an association class is returned in preference. to the figedge portion.. if no fignode is found then a figedge is searched for and the fignode. that acts as its edge port is returned.. param lay the layer containing the fig. param modelelement the model element to find presentation for. return the fignode presentation of the model element.
DESIGN	todo build a return parameter
DESIGN	todo how to merge multiple inheritance? necessary? this currently copies the common ancestors multiple times
DESIGN	todo this can t depend on projectbrowser. alternate below
DESIGN	todo this is a composite association so these will get deleted automatically. the only thing we need to do is check for any additional elements that need to be deleted as a result.
DESIGN	todo this is well formedness rule from uml1.4.2 4.5.3.20 2 no generalizableelement can have a parent generalization to an element that is a leaf. self.parent forall s not s.isleaf
DESIGN	check arguments against parameters for type and number todo perhaps move this to a critic instead? tfm 20070326
DESIGN	todo add standard stereotype? set is open ended but predefined names include call create instantiate send
DESIGN	todo is there anyway we can determine this size at runtime?
DESIGN	. we are getting events we don t want. filter them out.. todo can we instruct the model event pump not to send these in the. first place? see defect 5095.. param event the event.
DESIGN	. modelimpl.getfacade .getrootelements gets all root elements. in the uml repository including available profiles that are not. part of the current project degrades performance .. . projectmanager.getmanager .getcurrentproject .getroots only. returns user model roots and no profiles.. . projectmanager.getmanager .getcurrentproject .getmodels gets. all root models but no root namespaces.. . todo which is best? is there any other way?.
DESIGN	. todo as currently coded this actually returns all behavioralfeatures. which are owned by classifiers contained in the given namespace which. is slightly different then what s documented. it will not include any. behavioralfeatures which are part of the namespace but which don t have. an owner..
DESIGN	todo performance. consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear at this point instead.
DESIGN	. delete a model element. implements cascading delete to make sure. model is still valid after element has been deleted. p . . the actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the. factories. for example a method deleteclass exists on corehelper. delete. methods as deleteclass should only do those extra actions that are. necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself. i.e. deleteclass. should only take care of things specific to umlclass. p . . the delete methods in the uml factories should not be called directly. throughout the code! calls should always refer to this method and never. call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly. the reason that it is. possible to call the deletexxx methods directly is a pure implementation. detail. p . . the implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if then else. tree. this is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to. the uml 1.4 metamodel. the last remark refers to the fact that the. uml 1.4 model uses multiple inheritance in several places.. this has to be taken into account. p . . todo the requirements of the metamodel could probably be better. determined by reflection on the metamodel. then each association. that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure. that it meets the requirements and if not be deleted. tfm p . . extensions and its children are not taken into account here. they do not. require extra cleanup actions. not in the form of a call to the remove. method as is normal for all children of mbase and not in the form of. other behaviour we want to implement via this operation.. . param elem. the element to be deleted. . see org.argouml.model.umlfactory delete java.lang.object .
DESIGN	don t allow connections to be created from a read only model element to any other todo this should be considered a workaround. it only works because by default we place newly created relationships in the namespace of the fromelement. the correct behavior in the presence of read only elements really depends on the type of connection as well as the writeability of both ends.
DESIGN	todo taken from figclassifierboxwithattribute to handle events on an attribute. all this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment fig for attributes
DESIGN	. an array of valid connections the combination of connecting class and. node classes must exist as a row in this list to be considered valid.. ul . li the 1st column is the connecting element.. li the 2nd column is the from element type.. li the 3rd column is the to element type.. the 3rd column is optional if not given then it is assumed to be. the same as the from element.. li the existence of a 4th column indicates that the connection is valid. in one direction only.. ul . todo this encodes not only what is legal in uml but also what argouml. knows how to create so not all legal connections are included. probably. should be split into two pieces 1 legal uml here and 2 supported in. argouml application someplace tfm 20060325 p . see also issue 3863. p . . most of these are subtypes of relationship which includes association . dependency flow generalization extend and include. dependency. includes binding abstraction usage and permission. associationrole and. associationclass are associations. the remaining items link transition . associationend message are non relationship types which argouml treats. as connections edges..
DESIGN	todo check for duplicates is this possible???
DESIGN	todo we also have code registering for the names of a tagged value like derived
DESIGN	. recursive method to get all subtypes.. . todo does this have a scalability problem?.
DESIGN	todo bob says we should not be listening here for addition and removal of attributes. this should be done in figattributescompartment.
DESIGN	don t wait on ourselves we ll deadlock! todo we might want to throw an exception here
DESIGN	todo must we calculate the whole list?
DESIGN	todo replace this recursive function by a loop like in getroot
DESIGN	. updates a compartment box. called from updatelayout if there is. a model event effecting the attributes operations and from. renderingchanged in all cases.. todo the above statement means that the entire contents of the. compartments are being rebuilt whenever an add remove. of an attribute operation or a reception is detected. it would be. better to have compartments listen for add and remove events. and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild. . remark mvw this is a bit exaggerated since the populate . method is already heavily optimized..
DESIGN	todo reconfigure exception handling to distinguish between errors that are possible due to bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors.
DESIGN	todo callers will need to be refactored to work around the change in the way multiplicities work tfm
DESIGN	and its stereotypes todo aren t stereotypes handled elsewhere?
DESIGN	todo because we get called on each and every change event when the model is in a state of flux we ll often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection. the only saving grace is that we re called so many times that on the last time things should be stable again and we ll get a good set of elements for the final update. we need a better mechanism.
DESIGN	todo some elements such as generalization are no longer named. for a transitional period we ll return a string so debug can continue but the calling code should probably be fixed. tfm 20070607 bob says these are the comments that were in facadeeumlimpl.getname. same trick is needed here for now.
DESIGN	. map of which resources are read only.. p . todo this needs to be managed per editingdomain..
DESIGN	. todo mvw would it not be better if this code. would go in starttexteditor not overruling mouseclicked .. but we made this fig not editable . to stop it from reacting on key presses.. anyhow this is a hack abusing a figtext gef does. not really support double clicking on a fig to trigger some action..
DESIGN	todo does corehelper getextendingclassifiers object element means all direct and indirect extending classifiers or only the direct extending classifiers?
DESIGN	todo this code appears to be designed to jump to the diagram containing the contents of the package that was double clicked but it looks like it s always searching for the name main instead of the package name. todo but in any case it should be delegating this work to to something that knows about the diagrams and they contents tfm
DESIGN	todo what is the behavior of this in the case of nested models?
DESIGN	todo is this returning extended elements or base classes?
DESIGN	todo instancespecification classifier association isn t navigable in this direction
DESIGN	a model element has been removed from this packages namespace if the fig representing that model element is on the same diagram as this package then make sure it is not enclosed by this package. todo in my view the fig representing the model element should be removed from the diagram. yet to be agreed. bob.
DESIGN	todo seems to work only with both loops check why.
DESIGN	todo this needs to be double checked. tfm
DESIGN	. used by pgml.tee.. return the class name and bounds together with compartment. visibility.. todo is this not duplicate with the parent?.
DESIGN	. this node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other. fignodes in argouml. it is actually an optional child fig or more precisely. a path item of a figedgemodelelement.. this allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the. association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a. comment to some other edge type.. gef can only attach edges to nodes by making this fig both a node and. containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge. connections.. todo we are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we don t really. require. we should attempt to make figedgeport extend fignode.. . author bob tarling.
DESIGN	. searches for a stereotype just like the given stereotype in all. given models and their sub namespaces .. the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet . otherwise it will be returned itself!. . todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter . but a name and a baseclass. p . todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass. p . todo should it only search for stereotypes owned by the model object? . . param models a collection of models. param stereo is the given stereotype. return stereotype.
DESIGN	. finds a stereotype in a given namespace . and all those in any sub namespace of the given namespace.. returns null if no such stereotype is found.. p . todo what if stereo.getname or stereo.getbaseclass is null?. then you know immediately that none will be found but is that the. correct answer?. currently null is returned in these cases. p . . todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter . but a name and a baseclass. p . todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass. p . todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is . equal to the given one inheritance does not work.. . return the stereotype found or null.. param ns is the namespace.. param stereo is the stereotype..
DESIGN	. creates a uml model element of the given type.. this only works for uml elements. if a diagram contains. elements of another type then it is the responsibility. of the diagram manage those items and not call this. method. it also only works for uml model elements that. are represented in diagrams by a node.. . param elementtype the type of model element to build. return the model element. todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model extent where. the new element should be created..
DESIGN	. builds a compositestate as top for some statemachine. p . todo confusing name this method should better. be named buildtopstateonstatemachine.. . param statemachine the given statemachine. return mcompositestate the newly build top state. see buildcompositestate object .
DESIGN	todo mvw this needs rethinking rework! i have the following questions why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used? ie why is there not a getstereotype string name string baseclass ? edited by d00mst
DESIGN	. todo this functionality is in the worn place. we should be able to. call setvisible on the compartment itself and then this class should. react to that event.. improvements will follow in later releases.. hence this method should not be considered stable for module developers.. param compartment the compartment to be changed. param isvisible true if the attribute compartment is visible.
DESIGN	. todo this should become private and only called from constructor. . see org.argouml.uml.diagram.ui.figcompartment populate .
DESIGN	remove all items in the group . otherwise the model event listeners remain . todo why does a figgroup not do this?
DESIGN	todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here. i can see something like this is needed though as events won t manage this quick enough. could we make figeditablecompartment.createmodelelement create the new child fig instance? it may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return bob.
DESIGN	. todo is this needed correct?. for when all compartments are hidden?.
DESIGN	. this tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when. importing.. if it is set then the critics could ignore those objects if they want.. . todo this is really belongs in a higher level utility class. that uses the facade s tagged value methods. also it needs to. be updated to use a uml 1.4 tagdefinition instead of a simple string..
DESIGN	. recognizer for n ary association.. . todo this is not a recognizer for some type. rename to. isnaryassociation?. . param handle candidate. return true if handle is an association.
DESIGN	todo is this needed?

DESIGN	todo having critics actions here introduces an unnecessary dependency on the critics subsystem. have it register its desired actions using an extension mechanism tfm
DESIGN	. true if an instance is allowed to be. invisible. this is currently only set true by figedgeport.. todo figedgeport should be removed from the fignodemodelelement. hierarchy and so the need for this removed..
DESIGN	todo we really want this class to have package scope however the reflection
DESIGN	todo there are lots and lots of magic numbers used in calculating positions and sizes. any time you see figs being placed at 10 10 use these constants instead. if you can reliably interpret calculations you can factor them out of there as well. add additional constants as needed to express other common factors tfm 20081201

DESIGN	todo we should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default. this depends on the default profile configuration containing the type integer to test properly. otherwise it will get created in the main project defeating the purpose
DESIGN	. called by propertychanged when it detects that a stereotype. has been added or removed. on removal the fignode removes its. listener to that stereotype. when a new stereotype is detected. we add a listener.. todo bob says in my opinion we shouldn t be doing this here.. figstereotype should always be listening to change of its. owners name.. figstereotypescompartment should always be listening for add. or remove of stereotypes to its owner.. those classes will need to pass some event to the fignode on. the awt thread only if a change results in a change of size. that requires a redraw.. p note runs at the model mdr thread p . param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change.
DESIGN	todo do we want the top level package here instead of the immediate parent?
DESIGN	. this is a template method called by the argouml framework as the result. of a change to a model element. do not call this method directly. yourself.. p override this in any subclasses in order to change what model. elements the fignode is listening to as a result of change to the model.. p . p this method is guaranteed by the framework to be running on the same. thread as the model subsystem. p . todo lets refactor this at some time to take umlchangeevent argument. . param event the umlchangeevent that caused the change.

DESIGN	todo the above doesn t work reliably in a constructor. we need a better way of getting default fig settings for the owning project rather than using the project manager singleton. tfm
DESIGN	. defines the methods to generate source code from the model. each class. providing code generation functionality must implement this to be recognized. by argouml as a code generator.. p . todo a gui independent mechanism to pass settings to the code generator is. needed similar to what we have for reverse engineering. see. link org.argouml.uml.reveng.importinterface getimportsettings and. link org.argouml.uml.reveng.settingstypes . . since 0.20 when it replaced the filegenerator interface..
DESIGN	todo this creates a dependency on the critics subsystem. we need a generic way for modules including our internal subsystems to request addition of actions to the popup menu. tfm 20080430
DESIGN	. changes the font for all figs contained in the given figgroup. p . . todo in fact there is a design error in this method . e.g. for a class if the name is italic since the class is abstract . then the classes features should be in plain font.. this problem can be fixed by implementing. the updatefont method in all subclasses.. . param fg the figgroup to change the font of..

DESIGN	todo workaround for gef redraw problem force all child figs into the same layer
DESIGN	this should not be looking for a namedelement . since this is not always about the name of this. modelelement alone.
DESIGN	. p determines if the figedge is currently connected to the correct. fignodes if not the edges is the correct fignodes set and the edge. rerouted.. p typically this is used when a user has amended from the property. panel a relationship from one model element to another and the graph. needs to react to that change.. p e.g. if the participant of an association end is changed.. p calls a helper method layoutthistoself to avoid this edge. disappearing if the new source and dest are the same node.. . todo this method is called far too frequently. it should only be called. when a specific event is received. it seems to be currently called whenever. any event is received from the owner.. . return boolean whether or not the update was sucessful.
DESIGN	. todo this class should be moved to package. org.argouml.uml.ui.behavior.common behavior.

DESIGN	todo this should get the containing project from the list of targets not from some global
DESIGN	. todo bob says this is a really nasty horrible hack.. shadowfig should not extend fignodemodelelement. instead. we require a base class fignode with common behaviour of all. nodes in argouml. shadowfig should extend that and. fignodemodelelement should extend that same base class adding. common functionality for fignode that represent model element.. see org.argouml.uml.diagram.ui.fignodemodelelement setshadowsize int .

DESIGN	. agency manages critics. since classes are not really first class. objects in java a singleton instance of agency is made and passed. around as needed. the agency keeps a registry of all critics that. should be applied to each type of design material. when a. design material instance is critiqued it asks agency to apply all. registered critic s. in the current scheme there is a thread that. proactively continuously critiques the design at hand even if. the user is idle! this is simple and it works. the disadvantage. is that all active critics related to a given design material are. applied regardless of the reason for the critiquing and a lot of. cpu time is basically wasted. p . . todo i am moving toward a more reactionary scheme in. which specific design manipulations in the editor cause critics. relevant to those manipulations to be applied. this transition is. still half done. triggers are the critiquing requests. the code. for triggers is currently dormant latent? . p . . todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer. they. either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently . perhaps using an interface to break the cycle. the designer singleton gets. passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem creating strong. coupling throughout. tfm 20070620. . author jason robbins.
DESIGN	. reply true iff this critic is relevant to the goals that the. designer is trying to achieve. by default all critic s are. relevant regardless of the goalmodel. really this is something for a. controlmech to compute but if a subclass of critic encapsulates. some information you may need to override this method. p . . todo i would like a better default action but goals. are typed and their values must be interpreted by critics. they. are not as generic as the decisionmodel.. . param dsgr the designer. return true if relevant.
DESIGN	todo this is a hack.. a much better way of doing this would be not to start. the critic in the first place..
DESIGN	. return true iff the given todoitem is still valid and should be. kept in the given designers todolist. critics that are not. enabled should always return false so that their todoitems will. be removed. subclasses of critic that supply multiple offenders. should always override this method. p . . by default this method basically asks the critic to again. critique the offending object and then it checks if the. resulting todoitem is the same as the one already posted. this is. simple and it works fine for light weight critics. critics that. expend a lot of computational effort in making feedback that can. be easily check to see if it still holds should override this. method. p . . todo maybe todoitem should carry some data to make. this method more efficient.. . inheritdoc .
DESIGN	. the decisionmodel is part of the state of the designer. it. describes what types of decisions or design issues the designer. is thinking about at the current time. critics that are relevant to. those decisions are made active critics that are not relevant are. made inactive.. . todo there is some notion that each decision has a. certain importanance at a certain time but i have not followed. through on that because i don t have good examples of how to. quantify the importance of a decision.. . todo right now the individual decisions are just. strings maybe they should have some non atomic structure?. . author jason robbins.
DESIGN	how much control should critics have over when they are relavant? does doing that in code instead of declaratively limit reasoning? how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization?
DESIGN	. this class models the designer who is building a complex design in. some application domain and needs continuous feedback to aid in the. making of good design decisions. p . . strong this area needs work especially as it is a. central idea of argo. strong p . . currently almost everything is hardcoded. what can be configurable?? p . . the todolist is dependent on this class . i.e. each designer has its todolist. p . . each designer has his own agency . which is the only class that knows all the critics. p . . this class listens to property changes from ...? p . . a designer can create todo items just like the critics. hence the designer. implements the poster interface. p . . todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer. they. either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently . perhaps using an interface to break the cycle. the designer singleton gets. passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem creating strong. coupling throughout. tfm 20070620. . author jason robbins.

DESIGN	this is a temporary hack until the notation provider. for a sd message will be able to parse successfully when the sequence. number is missing.. remove this method completely then.
DESIGN	todo calcbounds is called by selectionmanager when the fig is dragged. this code is needed to reposition any self message as they are become detached from their classifier role see issue 5562 . the cause of the detachment is not yet understood. unfortunately calcbounds is called from several other places so the code here is not optimal but is the best workaround until argouml can provide its own replacement selectionmanager for sequence diagram requirements see http gef.tigris.org issues show bug.cgi?id 344
DESIGN	. the default behaviour from figedgemodelelement is not correct. here. see issue 5005. todo we must determine what to do here but for. now doing nothing is better. i m not sure why the super method would. not work as i would expect that to do nothing if the ends are already. correct.. return true at all times for now.

DESIGN	convert to bounding box very screwy! gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text at the nominal baseline which is well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly
DESIGN	. this is the interface for registering interest in events sent from. the model component. p . . neither the registration or unregistration nor the events themselves. contain any reference to the model implementation. instead they. use the link java.beans.propertychangelistener . link java.beans.propertychangeevent to. deliver events. p . . the reference to the listener is a weakreference so you don t need to. call removewhateverlistener you can just forget about your listener. and it is eventually finalized and removed. this also means that you. will have to keep a reference to your listener while it is active.. since the garbage collecting mechanism is not really deterministic. a forgotten about listener might still receive events. unless it can. handle them in a harmless way this approach should not be used.. . todo is this still true or does it refer to the nsuml. implementation? tfm 20051109 . this is part of the contract that is established between the model. subsystem and its users. if that is not fulfilled by the current. implementation then the current implementation is incorrect.. linus 20060411 . p . . todo what event names?. the event names generated are link string s and their values and. meanings are not really well documented. in general they are the. name of an an association end or attribute in the uml metamodel. p . . here are some highlights ul . li remove event sent when the element is removed.. ul . . author linus tolke.

DESIGN	todo we don t want to do this once we have dropped uml1.3 map uml 1.4 names to uml 1.3 equivalents
DESIGN	todo comment by a rueckert i don t think it makes much sense to query interactions from a collaboration in uml2 since this diagram does no longer exist and an interaction means something different in uml2.
DESIGN	todo comment by a. rueckert a rueckert gmx.net i think the handle holding the collaboration implementation should rather be a collaborationuse in uml2. but as a workaround for now i ll try to get a collaboration representation collaborationuse and then try to get the owning classifier from there...
DESIGN	todo this probably can t be implemented in a way that will make the uml 1.4 ui happy. needs to be generalized to uml 2 semantics.
DESIGN	todo what do we want to use as an equivalent here?
DESIGN	todo is there an option we can use to save our argouml version?
DESIGN	todo just a guess probably not right tfm return handle instanceof linkenddata
DESIGN	todo the uml 1.4 concept of a multiplicity multiplicity range has been replaced by a single element
DESIGN	todo not sure the semantics are an exact match here between uml 1.4 aggregate and uml 2.x shared.
DESIGN	todo changed in uml 2.x to special type of property?
DESIGN	todo tagdefinitions are gone from uml 2 they are now properties of stereotypes
DESIGN	todo moved this out of the implementation specific piece tfm everything is primary for now ie not reverse engineered
DESIGN	. this keeps track of the editing domain that is used to track all changes. to the model.. p . todo this probably needs to be a set of editingdomain so that we can. manage an editingdomain per project..
DESIGN	todo this method is mostly entirely? redundant tfm
DESIGN	todo actionstate callstate and subactivitystate have been replaced in uml 2.0 by explicitly modeled actions
DESIGN	todo this doesn t belong in the implementation specific piece tfm
DESIGN	todo the javadoc specifies that null should be returned if from or to are null or if there are no associations between them. we should return an empty collection instead and the javadoc should be changed.
DESIGN	todo this isn t right
DESIGN	todo support more than one body language
DESIGN	todo does corehelper getextendedclassifiers object element means all parents direct and indirect or only the direct parents?
DESIGN	todo what is the purpose of this? why do we hide buttons here? presumably if so we should not assume selectionclass
DESIGN	todo we currently delete the old values before setting to something new. this is a workaround to issue 6056. we should consider giving an api to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values.
DESIGN	todo in uml2.x event has no parameters. the event metaclass in uml1.x corresponds to the trigger metaclass in uml2.x see uml superstructure page 456 .
DESIGN	todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml 2.x metamodel if not replaced by reflection
DESIGN	don t implement deprecated method in interface.
DESIGN	todo booleanexpresion is removed from uml2.x is it ok to use valuespecification?
DESIGN	todo this will need to be adapted to send undo redo commands back to our consumer e.g. argouml if a new undo mechanism is implemented for the model subsystem tfm

DESIGN	. an array of valid connections the combination of connecting class and. node classes must exist as a row in this list to be considered valid.. ul . li the 1st column is the connecting element.. li the 2nd column is the from element type.. li the 3rd column is the to element type.. li the 3rd column is optional if not given then it is assumed to be. the same as the to element.. li the existence of a 4th column indicates that the connection is valid. in one direction only.. ul . todo this encodes not only what is legal in uml but also what argouml. knows how to create so not all legal connections are included. probably. should be split into two pieces 1 legal uml here and 2 supported in. argouml application someplace tfm 20060325 p . . most of these are subtypes of relationship which includes association . dependency flow generalization extend and include. dependency. includes binding abstraction usage and permission. associationrole and. associationclass are associations. the remaining items link transition . associationend message are non relationship types which argouml treats. as connections edges..
DESIGN	workaround for missing ability to parse
DESIGN	todo can we get this info from uml2 plugin? perhaps collect all references in the metamodel filter for those which represent containments and find the types on either end tfm
DESIGN	todo use getmodelelementcontainer for transition
DESIGN	todo we shouldn t actually have to do all this work
DESIGN	todo hook this creating of a new resource in to someplace more more appropriate perhaps createmodel ? better yet add a new method to model api to create a new top level project model xmi file so we don t depend on side effects
DESIGN	todo check for resource to hold this and create if necessary? this is a discrepancy between mdr which does it here and euml which does it as part of setrootmodel
DESIGN	todo get setrootmodel aren t specific to the model implementation they could probably be moved elsewhere tfm 20070530
DESIGN	i think that the synchronized access to idtoobjectmaps is required in order to respect the thread safe nature of the object. fixme maybe this should be moved into xmireferenceresolverimpl because it depends on internal implementation details of it.
DESIGN	todo we can choose between something which matches uml 1.4 in name or something that matches in functionality. we ve chosen functionality for now but this will create a name conflict during the migration process. tfm
DESIGN	todo change to throw exception when uses are fixed throw new notimplementedexception non nls 1
DESIGN	. a near clone of this code works fine outside of argouml but throws a. null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml i. think it s something to do with the class libraries being used but i. can t figure out what so i ve done a simpler less efficient stepwise. translation below in serialtransform.
DESIGN	todo bob says coding by use of side effect here. maybe this should be done in a clearer way but it fixes http argouml.tigris.org issues show bug.cgi?id 4978 it seems that when loading an xmi that is not contained in a zip file then the inputstream given as the argument to this method can t be reused as it is at the end of the stream. in that case systemid appears to be none null at this stage. so if systemid is not null we recreate the inputsource.
DESIGN	create temporary file for output todo we should be able to chain this directly to xmi reader
DESIGN	. xmiwriter implementation for mdr.. . this implementation is clumsy because the specified writer interface wants. characters while the xmiwriter wants an outputstream dealing in bytes. we. could easily create a writer from an outputstream but the reverse is not. true.. . todo the old writer based interface can be removed when the deprecated. modelimplementation.getxmiwriter is removed.. . author lmaitre. .
DESIGN	todo return empty collection on null input or throw illegalargument?
DESIGN	todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality of 1 if we allow it we at least need a critic to warn about it
DESIGN	apply profile stereotype to make it a profile our convention hack create that stereotype instead using the uml 1.4 profile
DESIGN	if systemid is a valid url simply use it. todo this causes a network connection attempt for profiles
DESIGN	todo make this work when the given stereotype. has more than one baseclass.. todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is. equal to the given one inheritance does not work.
DESIGN	todo this should call the single namespace form getstereotype it2.next stereo
DESIGN	todo still not used because in argouml string is hardwired
DESIGN	todo mvw do we really look into super types of the stereotype . or should we be looking into super types of the baseclass?
DESIGN	todo using just the last piece of the id leaves the potential for name collisions if two linked files have the same name in different directories
DESIGN	todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing all and then adding all tfm 20070806
DESIGN	todo what type of validation can we do here on tagtype?
DESIGN	todo this can be simplified to just include extend .setbase usecase base
DESIGN	anything not found is newly created so return a null systemid indicating that it is in the parent document. todo this assumption will be invalid if when we allow editing of linked sub models
DESIGN	todo distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved at end of load and should be reported to user.
DESIGN	todo is this adequate for finding profiles in java webstart jars? tfm
DESIGN	todo check whether this is really needed. i think it s left over from an incomplete understanding of the magicdraw composition error problem tfm
DESIGN	todo not sure whether the above is better in some cases but the code below is better for both java web start and eclipse.
DESIGN	todo this returns a collection not a single object is this what the callers expect?
DESIGN	. todo this code manually processes the elementimports of a. package but we need to check whether mdr already does something. similar automatically as part of its namespace processing.. tfm 20060408.
DESIGN	todo this has different semantics than everything else
DESIGN	todo an iterator filter would be nice here instead of the mucking around with the collection.
DESIGN	todo this does not belong here use getimportedelement.
DESIGN	todo rationalize this with getmodelelementcontainer
DESIGN	todo temporary stopgap for enumerationliteral
DESIGN	todo more is required here to support referencevalues
DESIGN	todo what other non modelelement types do we need to handle here?
DESIGN	todo this assumes ranges are sorted. is this true? tfm
DESIGN	this causes problems. it can make multiple return messages refer to the same activator even if not returning to the same classifier role as the activator emenates from. i m not sure that changing the activator of one message should amend any other messages but this is certainly changing too many bob.
DESIGN	todo i18n this needs to be localized but we don t have any localization capabilities in the model subsystem object args typename elemname alias misc.name.element import.alias imported 0 1 alias 2 return translator.localize misc.name.element import.alias args
DESIGN	. register a listener for metamodel class and all its. subclasses optionally qualified by a list of. property names.. . todo verify that property event names are legal for. this class in the metamodel.
DESIGN	todo do we want to construct an artificial name here?
DESIGN	todo implement support for types other than string
DESIGN	todo this should be done after all events are delivered but leave it here for now to avoid last minute synchronization problems
DESIGN	only do verification if debug level logging is on todo should we leave this on always? tfm
DESIGN	. todo mvw this needs rethinking rework! i have the following questions . why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties. and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used? ie why is. there not a getstereotype string name string baseclass ? edited by. d00mst these comments imported from nsuml implementation tfm . . see org.argouml.model.extensionmechanismsfactory buildstereotype java.lang.object java.lang.object java.lang.object .
DESIGN	todo the type of the model element used in a type parameter ie the formal needs to match the actual parameter that it gets replaced with later. this code is going to restrict that to always being a parameter which doesn t seem right but i don t have time to debug it right now. tfm 20090608
DESIGN	todo this should be built by reflection from the metamodel tfm update for uml 1.4 metamodel if not replaced by reflection
DESIGN	todo a minimal update strategy would be better here to minimize work and events firing but it may be better to deprecate the method and force calls to manage updates themselves since they probably usually want to just add or remove a single element tfm 20061108
DESIGN	todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing everything and adding it again. tfm
DESIGN	todo this actually returns permissions with stereotypes of both access and import when the spec calls for only the former but that seems to give different semantics to the way package imports work. review to see which is wrong.
DESIGN	todo do we want to friend stereotypes too? model.getextensionmechanismshelper .hasstereotype permission modelmanagementhelper.friend stereotype
DESIGN	todo we have multiple string representations for multiplicities these should be consolidated. this form is used by org.argouml.uml.reveng
DESIGN	. get elementresidences.. . todo unused. should be added to facade? tfm. . param handle a modelelement. return collection the elementresidence for this model element.
DESIGN	todo this is ambiguous as to whether it should be adding a container or resident.
DESIGN	todo this should either be extended to support all aggreationkinds or it should be simplified removed from the api tfm 20070331
DESIGN	todo it doesn t really make sense that a namespace would be returned as part of its own contents but that s the historical behavior.
DESIGN	todo perhaps use a hashset or other collection with faster lookup performance in case our callers are doing naive .contains lookups
DESIGN	todo try reusing the same set on every recursion
DESIGN	check that the two elements aren t already linked the opposite way todo this is a part implementation of well formedness rule uml1.4.2 4.5.3.20 3 circular inheritance is not allowed. not self.allparents includes self
DESIGN	todo this is a part implementation of well formedness rule uml1.4.2 4.5.3.20 3 circular inheritance is not allowed. not self.allparents includes self
DESIGN	todo this is not according the contract for this function but. it is used in several places and i mvw presume that. we need this generally.. this part 1 is about drawing an import permission. between packages.. the part 2 below is about modelmanagement.elementimport.
DESIGN	todo should we handle access and import ?

DESIGN	todo this should probably throw an exception if it gets invalid arguments rather than just returning null
DESIGN	todo delete old multiplicity? why is copy using hard coded value? tfm
DESIGN	. todo as currently implemented this expects a list of. multiplicityranges. is this an interface change from the nsuml. implementation? i suspect it used to accept a list of integers. tfm. . see org.argouml.model.datatypesfactory createmultiplicity java.util.list .
DESIGN	todo getallpossiblesubvertices and getallsubstates are duplicates tfm
DESIGN	. todo copied from umldiagramrenderer.. . find the figs in the given layer that should be the source and. destination and attach these to either end of the figedge. param layer the layer to look for the fignodes. param newedge the edge to attach.

DESIGN	. the constructor.. . param expressionmodel. expression model should be shared between language and body. fields. param notify. set to true to forward events to model. only one of language. and body fields should have this set to true.. todo mvw i do not understand that..
DESIGN	. to simplify implementation we list all associations. found with any of the classifiers. represented by the linked instances. p . . todo make a foolproof algorithm that only allows selecting associations. that create a correct model. also take into account n ary associations. and associationclasses. this algo best goes in the model subsystem e.g.. in a method getallpossibleassociationsforalink .. . see org.argouml.uml.ui.umlcomboboxmodel buildmodellist .
DESIGN	. . todo try to use valuefield.getcomponent .
DESIGN	todo ?? use an other checkbox defines in argo and extends jcheckbox
DESIGN	mvw for this case i had to move the. call to setselecteditem outside the buildingmodel . otherwise the combo does not update. with the new selection. see issue 5418..
DESIGN	todo consider a conditional feature in the xml panel def for this
DESIGN	. todo is is really used ?. . see javax.swing.jcomponent removenotify .
DESIGN	todo bob says the reflective code following should be replaced with something more specific like this commented out code. this would mean we need stype changed to a meta type object rather than a string.
DESIGN	. todo are the 3 methods uses ?.
DESIGN	. an opaqueexpression can have n body n language. . when display to user we only show one body. a ... button is enabled for. edit other.. . todo can we by import xmi have 0 language body ?. . author laurent braud.
DESIGN	todo we have some quirk that the a baseclass addition or removal from a steroetype comes back as an attributechangeevent rather than an associationchangeevent. this needs further investigation to see if this can be made consistent.
DESIGN	todo rather than specifically ignore some item maybe it would be better to specifically state what items are of interest. otherwise we may still be acting on other events we don t need
DESIGN	todo this needs work.... we also need to listen to addition removal. of states to from a classifierinstate..
DESIGN	todo we may want to restrict the list to parameters which conform to the following wfr parameter.type ofstype or parameter.kind in and ofstype.allsupertypes includes type or parameter.kind out or parameter.kind return and type.allsupertypes includes ofstype or parameter.kind inout and ofstype.allsupertypes includes type or type.allsupertypes includes ofstype
DESIGN	todo getallmodelelementsofkind should probably do this processing of imported elements automatically
DESIGN	todo part of this is copied from actiondeletemodelelement. we maybe need some subclass for common code.
DESIGN	todo we should really test the model instead for this but we have no api yet. can we just check if the collection to build the jlist control implements the list interface?

IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe should stop at first or find highest priority.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo how to implement this method properly?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make this final asap.
IMPLEMENTATION	now we know that this critic is still valid. what we need to figure out is if the corresponding to do item is still valid. the to do item is to be replaced if the name of some offender has changed that affects its description or if the contents of the list of offenders has changed. we check that by creating a new todoitem and then verifying that it looks exactly the same. this really creates a lot of to do items that goes to waste.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what should we do here?
IMPLEMENTATION	the following debug line is now the single most memory consuming line in the whole of argouml. it allocates approximately 18 of all memory allocated. suggestions for solutions check if there is a log.log level.fine string string method that can be used instead. use two calls. for now i linus just comment it out. log.log level.fine applying critic headline
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why do we need this when we can just change the font and achieve the same effect?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should we be doing anything on deleted elements? this throws an exception on remove events. skip for now tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo allow other configuration handlers.
IMPLEMENTATION	if we weren t given a system id attempt to use the url for the jar that we were loaded from. why? tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo register listener for target todo item changes and for new showstep requests
IMPLEMENTATION	todo review priority of public id vs system id has been reversed from original implementation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this shouldn t require two passes through the list tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	. compute which critics should be active i.e. they can be. applied by applyallcritics for a given designer. p . . note i am setting global data i.e. the. isenabled bit in each critic based on the needs of one designer.. i don t really support more than one designer.. which is why each designer. if we would support more than one designer . has his own agency.. . todo should loop over simpler list of critics not compoundcritics. . param d the designer.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why is this disabled always?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should have an image of a wizard or some logo

IMPLEMENTATION	todo this code can be removed when getcurrentproject is removed
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we just do this every time no need for else bob
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tentative implementation. do we want something that updates the list of open projects or just simple open and close events? tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add empty placeholder here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo needs completing stub implementation only! tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo needs i18n
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this removed from uml2 ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this should only be checking for the top level package if anything at all
IMPLEMENTATION	use a little trick to find out where argo is being loaded from. todo use a different resource here. argoini is unused and deprecated
IMPLEMENTATION	todo placeholder implementation until support for tracking on a per project basis is implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it is a performance drain to load all classes at startup time. they should be lazy loaded when needed. instead of scanning all classes for ones which implement our loadable module interface we should use a manifest entry or a special name name pattern that we look for to find the single main module class to load here. tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	enable it. todo this by default selects all modules that are found. eventually we would rather obey a default either from the modules themselves from how they are found and also have information on what modules are selected from the configuration.
IMPLEMENTATION	if it s a jar clean it up and make it look like a file url
IMPLEMENTATION	we also show tagged values for uml 1 todo what to do for uml2 here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we have any potential consumers of the unversioned name outside of the notation subsystem?
IMPLEMENTATION	. the constructor.. todo why does this method not handle all settings?.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo these defaults need to be checked against historical ones
IMPLEMENTATION	todo shouldn t we do something here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle parse error
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this try catch will be needed . once the code below is improved.
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo this name of the expression language should be. configurable by the user. p . . according to the uml standard . the expression language should be the same. for all elements in one diagram. p . . uml is not a sensible default usually this is some pseudo language.. . return the name of the expression language.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why aren t we throwing an exception here? returning null results in npe and no explanation why.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we need to control separately for attributes and operations?
IMPLEMENTATION	we need to extend the extensionmechanismsfactory so that . we can replace the above deprecated call with something like this
IMPLEMENTATION	empty implementation.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this needs more work! . we simply throw the new extension point away?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo find a better default language todo we should know the notation language since it is us
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we put the static block within the init ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo reuse the offender list.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo in the next line i should use buildguard . but it doesn t show the guard on the diagram.... why? mvw .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this a good way of handling nested notation?. the following fails the tests . new transitionnotationuml t .parse line .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this a good way of handling nested notation?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add stereotype application ecore anytype?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want isaumlelement here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo any special handling for null names? append will use null
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this dtd doesn t exist so we can t tell readers to look for it w.println !doctype profile system profile.dtd but we need a 2nd line to make the funky uml persister work remove this line if the above is uncommented
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add implementation.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we need the project specific diagram settings here
IMPLEMENTATION	ignored it shouldn t have been in the project in the 1st place
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add recent patterns

IMPLEMENTATION	todo investigate the unnamed opposite end
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support real numbers
IMPLEMENTATION	todo investigate abstraction.mapping is not in the model subsystem
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement oclexpression
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implementationlocation??
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement the difference between ocliskindof and oclistypeof
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this should really be coded the other way round to only act on associations which are important for representing the current perspective and to only act on a single end of the association tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want to use the project here instead of just its name?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this could be made more efficient by working with iterators directly and creating a composite iterator made up of all the various sub iterators.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this is going to cause the color to be reset on a refresh
IMPLEMENTATION	todo presentation??
IMPLEMENTATION	for tagged values use their containing modelelement since they don t have property panels of their own todo may want to do this for other types too?
IMPLEMENTATION	reorder submenu todo i think this requires i18n but not sure tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	empty implementation not used.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add a button to force garbage collection
IMPLEMENTATION	todo only fetch names and defer fetching panels until needed
IMPLEMENTATION	hide save action during load. otherwise we get the appearing in title bar and the save enabling as models are updated todo do we still need this now the save enablement is improved?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo replace the functioncall in the next line. by .requestfocusinwindow once. we do not support java 1.3 any more..
IMPLEMENTATION	todo beautify the 2nd part of this string
IMPLEMENTATION	the text box containing the problem messages todo this should be hidden by default but accessible on via a details button or tab to provide more info to the user.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo a better implementation would be to batch events into logical groups and update the tree one time for the entire group synchronizing access to the model repository so that it stays consistent during the query. this would likely require doing the updates in a different thread than the event delivery thread to prevent deadlocks so for right now we protect ourselves with try catch blocks.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo the copy function is not yet. completely implemented so we will. have some exceptions here and there.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want all enabled tabs to listen or only the one that is selected visible? tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	. the drag gesture listener is notified of drag gestures by a recognizer.. the typical response is to initiate a drag by invoking. dragsource.startdrag .. p . . todo find a way to show a different image when multiple elements are. dragged.. . param draggestureevent. the draggestureevent describing the gesture that has just. occurred. see java.awt.dnd.draggesturelistener draggesturerecognized java.awt.dnd.draggestureevent .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other types of drag.. here you set the owner by dragging into a namespace.. an alternative could be to drag states into composite states....
IMPLEMENTATION	. returns a set union of all unique applicable stereotypes for a given. collection of model elements. todo this is not optimized for. performance.. . param elements the given collection of model elements. return the set with stereotype uml objects.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle n way associations

IMPLEMENTATION	. called after the diagram font gets changed. p . . todo do we need to do anything here?. . see java.beans.propertychangelistener propertychange java.beans.propertychangeevent .
IMPLEMENTATION	do we have 2 connection ends?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we need to be more specific here about what to build
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mark diagram project as dirty?
IMPLEMENTATION	additional cleanup needed because this would not be removed by ext.destroy
IMPLEMENTATION	todo consider inherited attributes?
IMPLEMENTATION	don t know what to do otherwise
IMPLEMENTATION	. a specialist selection class for figpartitions.. this ensures that all swimlanes are the same length ie height .. todo make sure that all swimlanes appear side by side uml spec. states separated from neighboring swimlanes by vertical solid. lines on both sides .. todo allow drag of the west and east edge to resize both the selected. fig and the fig connected to that side.. todo show northwest and southwest handle only on leftmost swimlane.. todo show northeast and southeast handle only on rightmost swimlane.. author bob.
IMPLEMENTATION	. the activity diagram. p . . todo finish the work on subactivity states..
IMPLEMENTATION	this may not actually make any difference at present the code behind addtrigger needs more work .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we have anything to add here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we may return the following when the. relocate has been implemented.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we really need to be listening for both of these events?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this comparison is very suspect it should use equals method. the code within the block is in fact never executed. i hesitate to change this now as it will trigger code has never been used before and am not aware of any problems that it usage may introduce. i do think that we need to be able to find a different way to implement the intent here which seems to be to correct edge drawings that should actually not be allowed bob
IMPLEMENTATION	associations not supported yet todo create appropriate classdiagramedge
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make another pass to deal with overlaps?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we may return something useful when the. relocate has been implemented like. all statemachines that are not activitygraphs.
IMPLEMENTATION	. stylepanel which adds a checkbox to show or hide the stereotype. p . todo i18n.. . author mvw tigris.org.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo to enable models and subsystems change this flag work started by markus i believe where does this stand? bob.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo todoitem stuff should be made an opaque extension
IMPLEMENTATION	todo for uml 2.x this is isstatic
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why do i need to do this?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this needs to be modified for uml 2.x
IMPLEMENTATION	for backward compatibility everything is above and right todo do in polar domain?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better here to continue the loop and try to build the rest of the compartment. hence try catch should be internal to the loop.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why are these different colors? tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo how to handle changes in shadowsize. from the project properties?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add unnamed or new or something? localized of course
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should we require a graphmodel in the constructor since our implementations of setnamespace are going to try and set the namespace on the graphmodel as well?
IMPLEMENTATION	perhaps something like the following would work instead rectangle drawingarea globals.cureditor .getjcomponent .getvisiblerect
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this must happen on the awt thread
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we need a better algorithm.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use this event mechanism to update the checkmark on the presentation tab
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if this turns out to be a performance bottleneck we can probably optimize the common case by caching our iterator and current position assuming that the next request will be for a greater index
IMPLEMENTATION	assert arrays.aslist properties .contains event.getpropertyname event.getpropertyname todo do we really always need to do this or only if notationprovider is null?
IMPLEMENTATION	let s test which situation we have. 3 possibilities 1. the nodes are already on the diagram we can use canaddedge for this. 2. one of the nodes is already on the diagram. the other has to be added. 3. both of the nodes are not yet on the diagram. for the time being we will only implement situation 1. todo implement situation 2 and 3.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo a more strongly typed data structure could be used here.
IMPLEMENTATION	. perform re routing if src dest nodes have changed.. . p this method needs to be armed by a previous mousedragged . to avoid the situation where the user just clicks on the node. then clicks on some unrelated fig without moving the edge.... . p todo improve the fig finding algorithm to find the top most fig. in the layer. will be useful for nested states in a statechart.. . see java.awt.event.mouselistener mousereleased java.awt.event.mouseevent .
IMPLEMENTATION	. a window that shows the progress bar and a cancel button. as a convenience to. callers which may be executing on a thread other than the swing event thread . all methods use swingutilities.invokelater or. swingutilities.invokeandwait to make sure that swing calls happen on the. appropriate thread.. p . todo react on the close button as if the cancel button was pressed..
IMPLEMENTATION	. write todo check if sections are not used within the file and. put them as comments at the end of the file.. hint use a second map to compare with the used keys.. . param filename the file name. param indent the current indentation. param outputlostsections true if lost sections are to be written.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo uml2 what do we do here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this show some documentation?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo these have been used for most instances of new figfoo x0 y0 ... but additional work is required to extract the constant from calculations etc.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo work here !
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what does the output directory have to do with the class path? project p projectmanager.getmanager .getcurrentproject entries.add p.getprojectsettings .getgenerationoutputdir
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this next line prevent loading a usecase . with a stereotype to grow. why?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i18n required
IMPLEMENTATION	. utility function to localize the given string with help text . and show it in the status bar of the argouml window.. this function is used in favour of the inline call. to enable later improvements e.g. it would be possible to. show a help balloon. todo work this out.. one matter to possibly improve show multiple lines.. . param s the given string to be localized and shown.
IMPLEMENTATION	compilecheckbox new jcheckbox namebutton compilecheckbox checkbox.compile generated source todo implement the compile feature. for now disable the checkbox. compilecheckbox.setenabled false southpanel.add compilecheckbox borderlayout.south
IMPLEMENTATION	. save the source language in the model.. p . todo support multiple languages now that we have uml 1.4 tagged values.. . param node. param language.
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo this transformation is java specific. we need a more. language notation scheme for specifying qualified names.. possible algorithm replace all punctuation with our. internal separator replace multiple separators with a single. instance for languages like c . what about i18n? tfm.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to add filechooser
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this needs to be improved even for nongui calling the config panel needs to be initialized
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement additional operations in 4.5.3.5
IMPLEMENTATION	. return the fully qualified name of a model element in java dot. separated format.. p . todo we really need a language independent format here. perhaps the list. of names that form the hierarchy? tfm.
IMPLEMENTATION	. generates a new unique id and returns it as a string. the contents. of the string is supposed to be unique with respect to all strings. generated by other instances of this class.. todo we should consider using java.util.uuid for this instead.. . return a string with unique content..
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add up down buttons to control the ordering of items
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other name kinds
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add all top level packages
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other kinds of tail
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this the right range here?
IMPLEMENTATION	. this class provides a text field that can be used to display. the text of all comments associated with an annotated modelelement.. . todo this could use more work. currently it returns all. comment.name or comment.body attributes concatenated together. into a single read only document.. . since 1 nov 2005. author tom morris tfmorris gmail.com .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we should assert this never happens before removing panels should control their own listeners
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo the project should be bound to the action when it is created?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better to defer this initialization until the panel actually needs to be displayed. perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later if we ve got something to display tfm 20070110
IMPLEMENTATION	. this panel contains radio buttons that represent the changeability. of an asssociation end.. . author jaap.branderhorst xs4all.nl. since jan 4 2003. . todo for uml 2.x this needs to be changed to be just readonly frozen . or not changeable ..
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what to do with the return value?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo property name will need to be updated for uml 2.x unfortunately we can specify two property names here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want to fire targetremoved here or is it enough to just stop updating the targets?
IMPLEMENTATION	. a mock modelimplementation. p . . the facade the modeleventpump the factories and helpers are all. created as mock objects using easymock. for each of them there. should also be a possibility to access their link mockcontrol . object.. todo create the rest of the getters for the control objects.. . author linus tolke.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what shall we do with the exception?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo with new reference resolving scheme the model sub system will cache the systemid of the profile open it and resolve the profile on its own. thus the java.util.list will be found and the return value will be present again... assertnotnull returnparamtype
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i suspect this isn t needed call isn t needed but don t remove till out of alpha beta stage
IMPLEMENTATION	. the uml 1.4 model elements to test.. . todo this needs to be updated with a version for uml 2.x..
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we need this? is this the same as emptyfig.getheight ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use reflection against the test case to ensure that it does not import non argouml classes
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe a return message already exists. check first and and if the first found has no activator then set this call message as the activator and skip the code below.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo before adding a new region make the last region its minimum size smallest size that will still contain all enclosed
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why do we need to remove then add the fig?
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo minimum height should not be calculated every time but only . when an figmessage has been added or removed.. currently doing that doesn t work because of an unknown problem. . how to test create only two crs and a create message between them. . then move the create message to the bottom!. until that is fixed the workaround is to call updateminimumheight . every time the minimum size is needed.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo expression and instancevalue how if anyone have an example.
IMPLEMENTATION	. finds the operation to which a callevent refers based on the given . transition. this function determines the context of the statemachine . that contains the given transition. if the context is a classifier then . all operations of this classifier are candidates. if the context is a . behavioralfeature then all operations of the owner classifier are . candidates. the first operation of which the name matches is the result.. for activity diagrams if the context is a package then. all operations of all classifiers in the package are candidates.. todo this function works for the most normal cases . but needs some testing for rare cases e.g. internal transitions .... todo the parameters of the candidates are ignored. maybe this . method should return a set of matching operations.. . author mvw. param trans object of type transition. param opname the name of the operation sought. return object the operation with the given name or null.
IMPLEMENTATION	. get the innermost containing model of a modelelement.. p . if no containing model can be found the outermost containing. modelelement is returned which could be the original element itself if. it has no owner .. p . this method is intended to return the innermost. containing model but there are circumstances where one may. really expect the outermost containing model or root package to. be returned e.g. where. it s being used to test if two elements are from disjoint namespace. hierarchies . hence there are two separate methods. with different semantics. the method link getroot object . returns the outermost containing object. . p . todo note also that some code uses. org.argouml.kernel.project getroot to navigate down from the top. instead of up from the bottom. we need to use a consistent algorithm for. this. tfm 20070724. . param handle. to the model element.. return model for the model element..
IMPLEMENTATION	there s more to be handled which still need to be implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	. builds an actor in the same namespace as the given actor. if. the object is not and actor nothing is built. p . . todo this shouldn t just silently fail if it is passed a bad. argument. this contract will change. tfm 20070607. . param model the namespace.. param actor the given actor. return actor the newly built actor.
IMPLEMENTATION	list transition result new arraylist transition todo not complete how to retrieve the transitions?

IMPLEMENTATION	todo not all namespaces are useful here any wfrs?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this work should be deferred until actually needed for display
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should be anything allowed by current diagram
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we expect an association end here check more carefully? tfm

IMPLEMENTATION	fix set the application name for mac os x
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what can we do with other kind of actions?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use the svgwriter2d implementation cmd new savesvgaction2 translator.localize action.save svg
IMPLEMENTATION	apparently this method is never called.
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo not implemented yet. the idea is that some. problems identified by critic s can be fixed with certain design. manipulations or transforms that can be applied automatically. to resolve the problem. this method replies true iff the given. problem can be fixed. the fixit method actually does the fix.. . see org.argouml.cognitive.poster canfixit org.argouml.cognitive.todoitem . also. see critic fixit.
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo not implemented yet. if the given todoitem can. be fixed automatically and the user wants that to happen then do. it. obviously this depends on the specific critic and. problem. by default this method does nothing.. . param item the todo item. param arg the design material ? .

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. this comment was included in a previous version before 1 2005 . of the test which had this assertion commented out . . interaction should not be removed when removing classifierrole.... maybe if the last message is removed from the interaction but even. then it s doubtfull since it will probably lead to backward. compatibility problems in save formats.. . but my reading of the uml 1.4 specification is that an interaction. without at least one message is definitely illegal so mdr is. doing the right thing by removing it in this case where we only. have a single message which then gets deleted. tfm.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. a fig designed to be the child of some fignode or figedge to display the. stereotypes of the model element represented by the parent fig.. currently multiple stereotypes are shown stacked one on top of the other . each enclosed by guillemets. p . . the minimum width of this fig is the largest minimum width of its child. figs. the minimum height of this fig is the total minimum height of its child. figs. p . . the owner of this fig is the uml element that is extended. with the stereotypes. we are listening to changes to the model . addition and removal of stereotypes. p . . this fig supports showing one keyword. as the first stereotype in the list. p . . there is no way to remove a keyword fig once added. p . . todo allow for uml2 style display where all stereotypes are displayed in. the same guillemet pair and are delimited by commas. the style should be. changeable by calling getorientation orientation . the swidget orientation. class can be used for this.. author bob tarling.

DEFECT	bug 124306 we should rely on xmlcalendar to normalize dave value to ensure that all date value fields are taken into account.
DEFECT	fb won t compile with vaj or no jikes fb object adapter adapterfactory.adapt mapping
DEFECT	eatm must fix isset bits.
DEFECT	is this an error???
DEFECT	line comments at the end of annotations are not a part of the range of annotation todo is not including line comments at the end of annotations a bug?
DEFECT	eatm in jdk 1.4 there will be an indexof on stringbuffer.
DESIGN	eatm call the deprecated method which does the same thing but might have an override in older code.
DESIGN	todo factor up into genbaseimpl
DESIGN	todo deprecate since getpluginclass is no longer called
DESIGN	ensure that this race condition is thread safe it doesn t matter who wins the race.
DESIGN	todo factor up into genbaseimpl?
DESIGN	todo this assumes we only get a set notification which isn t a good assumption.
DESIGN	dms handle this well.
DESIGN	unused?
DESIGN	fb tbd can we come up with a better algorithm for choosing the default label feature?
DESIGN	dms what if eclipse is running but an invalid facade has been specified? we still should format code use encoding ...
DESIGN	dms do a better job with specific exceptions? just use chained runtimeexceptions?
DESIGN	if the delegate uri can be handled as a file we ll hope that renaming it will be really efficient.
DESIGN	assume that it s an attribute for now. it will could become a reference if the type resolves to an eclass.
DESIGN	do nothing for now and avoid propagating the exception. how should builders handle cancel?
DESIGN	this is a fall back however this should never be called
DESIGN	todo fix the space above
DESIGN	todo remove this bogus empty line
DESIGN	todo handle class cast exception better.
DESIGN	i don t know if we should be run this deferred because we might have to give the editor a chance to process the viewer update events and hence to update the views first.
DESIGN	this is a big festering hack to make the images the right size from the start.
DESIGN	eatm demand create metadata needs to depend on processing mode...
DESIGN	tbd return user selected subset? of referenced packages that contain super classes of classes in this package.
DESIGN	call the workaround
DESIGN	tbd rethink where exactly some of the following methods belong genmodel or genpackage
DESIGN	eatm this would be wrong.
DESIGN	call workaround
DESIGN	the label is not used.
DESIGN	motif kludge we would get something random instead of null.
DESIGN	todo so what should be the etype be now?
DESIGN	eatm kind of hacky.
DESIGN	this runs the operation and shows progress. it appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread.
DESIGN	this is a kludge to deal with enumerators which crash the doswitch.
DESIGN	this is copied from itemprovideradapterfactory.
DESIGN	eatm this might be better written as a single loop for the eobject case?
DESIGN	dms why not this? new subprogressmonitor progressmonitor 1
DESIGN	second alternative should be getmodelproject ?
DESIGN	todo this is really quite attrocious since there is code that will assume an iterator that returns strings!
DESIGN	todo hack that should be removed.
DESIGN	todo specialize this to return a resource locator for messages specific to this validator. ensure that you remove generated or mark it generated not
DESIGN	todo i m concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403. so should we consider something to exist even though access if unauthorized or forbidden?
DESIGN	only file scheme uris will be re encoded. if a uri was decoded in the workaround above and platform.resolve didn t return a file scheme uri then this will return an decoded uri.
DESIGN	this functionality should eventually go away as it is replaced by model exporters. we ll just delegate to the deprecated genpackage method. the monitor isn t used so we won t pass it.
DESIGN	the eannotations and egenerictype are possible containment references. we ll move them instead of copying
DESIGN	temporary structure to hold node s attributes namespaces in scope
DESIGN	hack reading encoding
DESIGN	because of the old factoring approach in the create method it might be the case that the state of the old value has changed by the time we get here and in that case we don t want to duplicate the removals in this code.
DESIGN	todo this is faster than many charat calls.
DESIGN	revisit remove this code.
DESIGN	revisit do we really need to support block names as in unicode 3.1 or we can just create all the names in isblockname format xml schema rec ?
DESIGN	note registry based authority is being removed from a new spec for uri which would obsolete rfc 2396. if the spec is added to xml errata processing of reg name needs to be removed. mrglavas.
DESIGN	revisit remove this code. store port value as string instead of integer.
DESIGN	bubble sort why? in many cases this.ranges has few elements.
DESIGN	per schema 1.0 it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid uri. for the future if we plant to support iris then it is better not to massage the initialvalue. we should thought consider where would be the best way to validate anyuri values el
DESIGN	note that the way they are sorted the values of index i always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list. eatm todo we could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result.
DESIGN	todo deprecate since no longer used by geteditpluginclass geteditorpluginclass gettestsuiteclass
DESIGN	if there are multiple variables in declaration separate this variable fragment into a separate declaration
DESIGN	dms should we let this exception out?
DESIGN	dms factor this into a method? use a non static subclass?
DESIGN	dms this doesn t really produce nice output.
IMPLEMENTATION	fb tbd filter out volatile and other inappropriate links?

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the algorithm for the order of the features in this list should never change. also the fact that a new list is created whenever the contents change is something else that should never change. there are clients who rely on both these behaviors and they will need to agree to any change so that they can adjust their own code.

DEFECT	this is only needed afaict for processing results from the query cache however this cannot possibly work in the case of discovered types...
DEFECT	note that this timestamp is not correct if the connection provider returns an older jdbc connection that was associated with a transaction that was already begun before opensession was called don t know any possible solution to this!
DEFECT	todo this is assertion is disabled because there is a bug that means the original owner of a transient uninitialized collection is not known if the collection is re referenced by a different object associated with the current session throw new assertionfailure bug loading unowned collection
DEFECT	this does not support the cache sql distinct by comma list extensions but this extension is not supported through hibernate anyway.
DEFECT	todo when this is the entry point we should use an inner join for fetching the many to many elements!
DEFECT	could happen for custom criteria impls. not likely but... for long term solution see hhh 3514
DEFECT	todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object the owner of the association is not the owner of the id
DEFECT	todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk and entity name fix this!
DEFECT	todo does not work for entitymode.dom4j yet!
DEFECT	todo deal with the optional attribute in the join mapping this code assumes that optional defaults to true because it doesn t actually seem to work in the fetch join code note that actual proper handling of optional ality here is actually more involved than this patch assumes. remember that we might have multiple join mappings associated with a single entity. really a couple of things need to happen to properly handle optional here 1 first and foremost when handling multiple join s we really should be using the entity root table as the driving table another option here would be to choose some non optional joined table to use as the driving table. in all likelihood just using the root table is much simplier 2 need to add the fk columns corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non optional data is present my initial thoughts on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new sequentialselect abstraction that actually gets generated in the persisters ok singletable... and utilized here. it would encapsulated all this required optional ality checking...
DEFECT	todo not really completely correct since the uoe could occur while resolving associations leaving the pc in an inconsistent state
DEFECT	todo this is kinda inconsistent with collectiontype
DEFECT	for a one to many a bag is not really a bag it is really a set since it can t contain the same element twice. it could be considered a bug in the mapping dtd that bag allows one to many .
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk fix this! only if when we can extract the id values....
DEFECT	todo old version did not require hashmap lookup keys collectionowner .getidentifier
DEFECT	todo this disables laziness even in non pojo entity modes
DEFECT	todo at the point where we are resolving collection references we don t know if the uk value has been resolved depends if it was earlier or later in the mapping document now we could try and use e.getstatus to decide to semiresolve trouble is that initializeentity reuses the same array for resolved and hydrated values
DEFECT	todo currently we don t know a sessionfactory reference when building the tuplizer this is a bug embedded xml false on component todo fix this after hhh 1907 is complete
DEFECT	todo this requires that the collection is defined after the referenced property in the mapping file ok?
DEFECT	todo currently we really do not handle valueinclusion.partial... valueinclusion.partial would indicate parts of a component need to be included in the select currently we then just render the entire component into the select clause in that case.
DEFECT	todo is this completely correct?
DEFECT	todo what if batchupdate is a callablestatement ? calls executebatch
DEFECT	this doesn t actually seem to work but it might work on some dbs. also it doesn t work if there are multiple columns of results because it is not accounting for the suffix return new string getdiscriminatorcolumnname
DEFECT	first validate all the enabled filters... todo this implementation has bad performance
DEFECT	todo passing null here because this method is not really used for dom4j at the moment but it is still a bug if we don t get rid of this!
DEFECT	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know the operand node type where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DEFECT	. algorithm. check for any level one nullability breaks. look at non null components to. recursively check next level of nullability breaks. look at collections contraining component to. recursively check next level of nullability breaks. . . in the previous implementation not null stuffs where checked. filtering by level one only updateable. or insertable columns. so setting a sub component as update false . has no effect on not null check if the main component had good checkeability. in this implementation we keep this feature.. however i never see any documentation mentioning that but it s for. sure a limitation..
DEFECT	assume that the row was not there since it previously had only null values so do an insert instead todo does not respect dynamic insert
DEFECT	todo this call will not work for anything other than pojos!
DEFECT	note that this implementation is kinda broken for components with many to one associations
DEFECT	no need to take a snapshot this is a performance optimization but not really important except for entities with huge mutable property values
DEFECT	todo this is broke for subqueries in statements other than selects...
DEFECT	. the following types are not supported in rdms jdbc and therefore commented out.. however in some cases mapping them to character columns works. for many applications but does not work for all cases..
DEFECT	todo should this be an error?
DEFECT	three general cases we check here as to whether to render a physical sql join 1 is our parent a dotnode as well? if so our property reference is being further de referenced... 2 is this a dml statement 3 we were asked to generate any needed joins generatejoins true or we are currently processing a select or from clause an additional check is the regression style join suppression check solely intended for the test suite the regression style join suppression is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite. this forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser. the underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of cases. the piece it generally tends to miss is that inner joins effect the results by further restricting the data set! a particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit joins if the query is shallow the result being that query.list and query.iterate could return different number of results!
DEFECT	todo figure out how this should be set. this was the reason for failures regarding index op and subclass joins on theta join dialects not sure what behaviour we were trying to emulate joinsequence joinsequence.getfrompart emulate the old addfromonly behavior.
DEFECT	the preference here would be sqlfunctiontemplate hibernate.timestamp current timestamp ?1 false but this appears not to work. jay nance 2006 09 22
DEFECT	todo inexact what we really need to know is are any outer joins used?
DEFECT	todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
DEFECT	todo not sure which either? is correct could not find docs on how to do this. did find various blogs and forums mentioning that select current timestamp does not work...
DEFECT	todo cannot use generatesuffixes it handles the initial suffix differently.
DEFECT	don t need this because we should never ever be selecting no columns in an insert ... select... and because it causes a bug on db2
DEFECT	starts with an alias old style semi bad thing about this can t re alias another alias.....
DEFECT	todo bug! this currently fails for named queries for non pojo entities
DEFECT	fixme we don t have the associated entity table name here has to be done in a second pass
DEFECT	this call is side effecty
DEFECT	rdms does not directly support the trim function we use rtrim and ltrim
DEFECT	note at least my local sql server 2005 express shows this not working...
DEFECT	note at least my local mysql 5.1 install shows this not working...
DESIGN	use count as the default. this mimics the old behavior although none might be a better option moving forward in the case of callable
DESIGN	perhaps not really necessary...
DESIGN	todo disable batch loading if lockmode read?
DESIGN	todo to handle concurrent writes correctly the client should pass in a lock
DESIGN	turn hibernate.c3p0. into c3p0. so c3p0 gets a chance to see all hibernate.c3p0.
DESIGN	note there is a wierd implementation in the client side
DESIGN	todo this was added to support initializing an entity s entityentry snapshot during reattach this should be refactored to instead expose a method to assemble a entityentry based on this state for return.
DESIGN	do we need to drop constraints before dropping tables in this dialect?
DESIGN	does this dialect support check constraints?
DESIGN	this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call start
DESIGN	does this dialect support the unique column syntax?
DESIGN	this is done here cos we might only know the type here ugly! todo improve this a lot
DESIGN	does this dialect support the for update syntax?
DESIGN	todo what is the implication of this?
DESIGN	todo yuck!!!
DESIGN	todo again how should this work for non pojo entities?
DESIGN	does this dialect support for update of allowing particular rows to be locked?
DESIGN	todo really bad evil hack to fix!!!
DESIGN	aliasrefnode.resolve false false aliasrefnode.gettext todo is it kosher to do it here? todo is it kosher to do it here?
DESIGN	todo better to degrade to lazy false if uninstrumented
DESIGN	does this dialect support the oracle style for update nowait syntax?
DESIGN	icky workaround for mysql bug
DESIGN	we have to set up the table later!! yuck
DESIGN	todo somehow add the newly created foreign keys to the internal collection
DESIGN	this inner class implements a case statement....perhaps im being a bit over clever here
DESIGN	todo merge into one method!
DESIGN	todo this is a bit of copy paste from indexedcollection.createprimarykey
DESIGN	todo what type?
DESIGN	todo inefficient
DESIGN	todo this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
DESIGN	todo redesign how propertyaccessors are acquired...
DESIGN	todo not so sure this is needed...
DESIGN	todo joinkeycolumnname foreignkeycolumnname should be called either here or at a. slightly higer level in the stack to get all the information we need . right now hbmbinder does not support the.
DESIGN	todo improve this hack!
DESIGN	todo bad implementation cos it depends upon ordering of mapping doc fixing this requires that collection persistentclass gain access to the mappings reference from configuration or the filterdefinitions map directly sometime during configuration.buildsessionfactory after all the types filter defs are known and before building persisters .
DESIGN	use of trim here is ugly?
DESIGN	todo ideally we need the construction of propertyaccessor to take the following 1 entitymode 2 entitymode specific data i.e. the classname for pojo entities 3 property specific data based on the entitymode i.e. property name or dom4j node name the easiest way with the introduction of the new runtime metamodel classes would be the the following predicates 1 propertyaccessorfactory.getpropertyaccessor takes references to both a org.hibernate.metadata.entitymodemetadata and org.hibernate.metadata.property 2 what is now termed a propertyaccessor stores any values needed from those two pieces of information 3 code can then simply call propertyaccess.getgetter with no parameters likewise with propertyaccessor.getsetter
DESIGN	ick!
DESIGN	todo this is very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since it does not take advantage of two phase load
DESIGN	todo should this be session.instantiate persister ... ?
DESIGN	todo suck this into initlaziness!
DESIGN	hibernate.temp.use jdbc metadata defaults is a temporary magic value. the need for it is intended to be alleviated with future developement thus it is not defined as an environment constant... it is used to control whether we should consult the jdbc metadata to determine certain settings default values it is useful to not do this when the database may not be available mainly in tools usage .
DESIGN	todo is this right??
DESIGN	ie. the subquery! yuck!
DESIGN	todo copy paste from recreate
DESIGN	workaround for backward compatibility of sets with no not null columns assume all columns are used in the row locator sql
DESIGN	just to help out during the load ugly i know
DESIGN	hack workaround as sqlquery impl depend on having a key.
DESIGN	todo handle the case of a foreign key to something other than the pk
DESIGN	todo assumes all collections disassemble to an array!
DESIGN	todo would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity subclass would emit a notification which the extendsqueue entries could react to...
DESIGN	todo is it really neceassry to provide configuration to collectionpersisters ? should it not be enough with associated class ? or why does entitypersister s not get access to configuration ? the only reason i could see that configuration gets passed to collection persisters is so that they can look up the dom4j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name was applied at the collection element level. are you kidding me? trivial to fix then. just store and expose the node name on the entity persister which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means... .
DESIGN	todo deprecated remove eventually
DESIGN	todo this is a bit dodgy come up with a better way to check this plus see above comment
DESIGN	use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility
DESIGN	todo this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a property reference per se.
DESIGN	todo better to handle dynamic filters through implicit dynamicfilterparameterspecification see the discussion there in dynamicfilterparameterspecification s javadocs as to why it is currently not done that way.
DESIGN	get the right object from the list ... would it be easier to just call getentity ??
DESIGN	todo should record how many properties we have reffered to and if we don t get em all we throw an exception! way better than trial and error
DESIGN	todo this dependency is kinda bad
DESIGN	why does this matter?
DESIGN	important to account for newly saved entities in query todo some kind of check for new status...
DESIGN	todo can we always use the null property approach for everything?
DESIGN	does this need holdlock also? return tablename with updlock rowlock holdlock
DESIGN	for sets we should end the collection load after resolving the entities since we might call hashcode on the elements todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	todo remove this and just have subclasses use isolater isolatedwork directly...
DESIGN	sql server at least needed this dropped after use strange!
DESIGN	is it necessary to register exact since it can only appear in a where clause?
DESIGN	for arrays we should end the collection load before resolving the entities since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	does this dialect support the alter table syntax?
DESIGN	this next bit is to allow for both unsaved value negative and for older behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object todo shift it into unsaved value strategy
DESIGN	todo reenable if we also fix the above todo
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during copy??
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during merge??
DESIGN	todo suck this logic into the collection!
DESIGN	todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry s
DESIGN	todo this bit actually has to be called after all cascades! but since identity insert is called synchronously instead of asynchronously as other actions it isn t
DESIGN	this class has no proxies so do a shortcut
DESIGN	todo should this be an initializeentityeventlistener??? watch out for performance!
DESIGN	todo need map? the prob is a proper key right?
DESIGN	todo better to pass the id in as an argument?
DESIGN	do we even really need this? the update will fail anyway....
DESIGN	todo would it be better to do a refresh from db?
DESIGN	. this form used from annotations ? . essentially the same as the above using a. resultset mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment.. . fixme annotations do not use it so it can be remove from my pov. deprecated. . . param query the sql query string. param resultsetref the result set mapping name. param queryspaces any specified query spaces used for auto flushing . param cacheable whether the query results are cacheable. param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the results. param timeout a jdbc level timeout to be applied. param fetchsize a jdbc level fetch size to be applied. param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query. param parametertypes parameter type map. param callable does the query string represent a callable object i.e. proc .
DESIGN	todo ugly here
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set... todo calling entryset on an identitymap is slow!!
DESIGN	todo i d much rather have this done from endloadingcollection collectionpersister loadingcollectionentry ...
DESIGN	todo hack!!! note here we cleanup the load context when we have no more local lce entries. this works for the time being because really only the collection load contexts are implemented. long term this cleanup should become part of the close result set processing from the sandbox jdbc jdbc container code.
DESIGN	todo add the notion of enabled filters to the cachekey to differentiate filtered collections from non filtered but cachekey is currently used for both collections and entities would ideally need to define two seperate ones currently this works in conjuction with the check on defaultinitializecollectioneventhandler.initializecollectionfromcache which makes sure to not read from cache with enabled filters . early exit!!!!!
DESIGN	postload is needed for ejb3 todo reuse the postloadevent...
DESIGN	todo should we check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	brand new collection todo or an array!! we can t lock objects with arrays now??
DESIGN	todo iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions 1 transientcopycache.size 0 2 transientcopycache.size is not decreasing and copycache.size is not increasing todo find out if retrying can add entities to copycache don t think it can... for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there are still any transient entities
DESIGN	null or brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle arrays which have no snapshot so we can t do any better
DESIGN	todo perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved value?
DESIGN	. provides query splitting methods which were originally in querytranslator.. br . todo this will need to be refactored at some point.. . author josh.
DESIGN	todo most of below was taken verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic or super type it
DESIGN	todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join. this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy. at some point we should expand this to support that capability. however that has some difficulties 1 the biggest is how to handle ors when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins. 2 here we would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the fromelement so it can pass it along to the joinsequence
DESIGN	no explicit select expression render the id and properties projection lists for every persister in the from clause into a single token node . todo the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filters we should get rid of derived select clause completely!
DESIGN	todo better way?!?
DESIGN	hack alert !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! attempt to work around ghost impliedfromelements that occasionally show up between the actual things being joined. this consistently occurs from index nodes at least against many to many . not sure if there are other conditions essentially look ahead to the next fromelement that actually writes something to the sql
DESIGN	not possible to simply re use the versionpropertynode here as it causes oom errors due to circularity
DESIGN	this function has a template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast to avoid using an interface? yuck.
DESIGN	at some point the generate phase needs to be moved out of here because a single object level dml might spawn multiple sql dml command executions. possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates queryloader statementexecutor themselves. also not sure why queryloader currently even has a dependency on this at all does it need it? ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegates directly...
DESIGN	todo this is only needed during compilation .. can we eliminate the instvar?
DESIGN	todo absolutely no usages of this constructor form can it go away?
DESIGN	todo is this a bit ugly?
DESIGN	even here if only properties mapped to the base table are referenced in the set and where clauses this could be handled by the basicdelegate. todo decide if it is better performance wise to perform that check or to simply use the multitableupdatedelegate
DESIGN	todo remove these last two as batcher is no longer managing connections
DESIGN	very important!!!! this class needs to be free of any static references to any cglib or javassist classes. otherwise users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which if either they use. another option here would be to remove the hibernate.ispropertyinitialized method and have the users go through the sessionfactory to get this information.
DESIGN	todo we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hql sql grammar expects all those node types to be fromreferencenodes. one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclause fromelement combo as a child of the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement. that s probably the easiest approach read least amount of changes to the grammar and code but just doesn t feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from clauses
DESIGN	todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters the table info gotten here should really be self contained i.e. a class representation defining all the needed attributes then we could then get an array of those
DESIGN	todo switch statements are always evil! we already had bugs because of forgotten token types. use polymorphism for this!
DESIGN	really there are two situations where it should be ok to allow the insertion into properties defined on a superclass 1 union subclass with an abstract root entity 2 discrim subclass 1 is handled already because of the fact that unionsubclasspersister alreay always returns 0 for this call... we may want to disallow it for discrim subclass just for consistency sake currently does not work anyway ...
DESIGN	implicit joins are always ? ok to reuse
DESIGN	todo used to be exprnoparens! was this needed?
DESIGN	todo we may also want to check that the types here map to exactly one column jdbc type can t think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi column mappings makes any sense.
DESIGN	we do not know either type blind guess!
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of here create an ast for the join expressions. use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression.
DESIGN	we would probably refactor to have logicparser builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not expressionparser translates from oo terms like foo foo.bar foo.bar.baz to sql terms like foos.id foos.bar id etc and pathexpressionparser which does much the same thing it does now
DESIGN	short circuit for performance...
DESIGN	not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release
DESIGN	try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name. this allows the we assume custom interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityname
DESIGN	todo this is one of the ugliest and most fragile pieces of code in hibernate....
DESIGN	todo implement functionality this might be painful to do here as the join post processing for the subquery has already been performed meaning that for theta join dialects the join conditions have already been moved over to the where clause . a simple solution here might to perform join post processing once for the entire query including any subqueries at one fell swoop
DESIGN	ignore it the incoming property could not be found so we cannot be sure what to do here. at the very least the safest is to simply not apply any dereference toggling...
DESIGN	todo potentially look at optimizing these two arrays
DESIGN	note that i parameter is now unused delete it?
DESIGN	todo figure out a better way to get the from elements in a proper tree structure. if this is not the destination of a many to many add it as a child of the origin.
DESIGN	todo this constructor form is only used from constructor directly below us can it go away?
DESIGN	we should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to processing a stream of tokens we instead build up a tree of expressions.
DESIGN	todo should this get moved to persistentcontext? logically is persistentcontext the thing to which an interceptor gets attached?
DESIGN	todo something much better look at the type of the other expression! todo have comparisonexpression and or arithmeticexpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes.
DESIGN	todo this class does too many things! we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent ways in which path expressions can occur
DESIGN	todo optimize this better!
DESIGN	todo should we allow suffixes on these ?
DESIGN	todo not sure the best way to handle this. the non performant way
DESIGN	todo is there a better way?
DESIGN	the class is now way to complex!
DESIGN	todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query def so as to not have to re calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset ref stuff...
DESIGN	name from a super query a bit inelegant that it shows up here
DESIGN	real hacky... used to count the nesting of parentheses
DESIGN	ugly hack for cases like elements foo.bar.collection multi part path expression ending in elements or indices
DESIGN	todo copy paste from sessionimpl pull up!
DESIGN	todo need to find a clean way to handle the event source role a seperate classs responsible for generating dispatching events just duplicates most of the session methods... passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext is not manageable...
DESIGN	must be done here because of side effect! yuck...
DESIGN	we should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way.
DESIGN	todo should remove this exposure and have all references to the session s batcher use the connectionmanager.
DESIGN	we may be screwed here since the collection action is about to execute and we do not know the final owner key value
DESIGN	needed the clazz check to work around union subclasses todo is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim column based inheritence?
DESIGN	work around a bug in all known connection pools....
DESIGN	todo reuse the preloadevent
DESIGN	need a better way to define the suffixes here...
DESIGN	workaround for weblogic
DESIGN	todo temporary
DESIGN	todo yuck!!! fix after hhh 1907 is complete
DESIGN	would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff. would need to change the way the max row stuff is handled i.e. behind an interface so that i could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
DESIGN	todo the i entityspan 1 bit depends upon subclass implementation very bad
DESIGN	some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take an aliased path or a path rooted at the creating criteria instance
DESIGN	todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package...
DESIGN	polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps...well actually its ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here which it will be
DESIGN	this is not very nice and quite slow
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of here
DESIGN	meant to handle dynamic instantiation queries... copy from queryloader
DESIGN	make sure this is a defined parameter and check the incoming value type todo what should be the actual exception type here?
DESIGN	worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here...
DESIGN	todo throw exception? maybe warn if not the same?
DESIGN	todo make entitypersister not depend on sessionfactoryimplementor interface if possible
DESIGN	todo what amount of significant digits need to be supported here? from the decimalformat docs significant digits minimum integer digits maximum fraction digits
DESIGN	for backward compatibility allow a set with no not null element columns using all columns in the row locater sql todo create an implicit not null constraint on all cols?
DESIGN	todo copy paste from manytoonetype
DESIGN	todo code duplication with singletableentitypersister
DESIGN	todo throw exception?
DESIGN	should this interface extend propertymapping?
DESIGN	todo here is why we need to make bytecode provider global todo again fix this after hhh 1907 is complete
DESIGN	todo currently keeps getters and setters instead of propertyaccessors because of the way getgetter and getsetter are implemented currently yuck!
DESIGN	todo yuck! this is not quite good enough it s a quick hack around the problem of having a to one association that refers to an embedded component
DESIGN	todo implement caching?! proxies?!
DESIGN	is this really necessary?
DESIGN	todo this is a little inefficient don t need to do a whole deep replaceelements call
DESIGN	todo this is a bit arbitrary expose a switch to the user?
DESIGN	. return collection removal. fixme even if isinverse true ?.
DESIGN	todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
DESIGN	todo move these to a new joinabletype abstract class extended by entitytype and persistentcollectiontype
DESIGN	todo would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly!
DESIGN	spaces todo i m not sure but perhaps we should exclude abstract denormalized tables?
DESIGN	todo is there a more elegant way than downcasting?
DESIGN	todo remove use of instanceof!
DESIGN	todo make this a bit nicer
DESIGN	todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private...
DESIGN	todo perhaps this should be some other runtimeexception...
DESIGN	yuck
DESIGN	todo need some caching scheme? really comes down to decision regarding amount of state if any kept on propertyaccessors
DESIGN	todo this eventually needs to be removed
DESIGN	todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory
DESIGN	todo we should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here
DESIGN	todo should this really return null? if not figure out something better to do here.
DESIGN	todo should seriously consider not allowing a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session...
DESIGN	should indicate that we are processing an insert update delete query with a subquery implied via a collection property function. here we need to use the table name itself as the qualification alias. todo verify this works for all databases... todo is this also the case in non indexed scenarios?
DESIGN	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DESIGN	todo make this the factory for entity mode related sessions also means making this the target of transaction synch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions at that point perhaps this thing is a sessioncontext and connectionmanager is a jdbccontext ? a sessioncontext should live in the impl package...
DESIGN	create an index on the key columns??
DESIGN	is this ok?
DESIGN	init the table here instead of earlier so that we can get a quoted table name todo would it be better to simply pass the qualified table name instead of splitting it up into schema catalog table names
DESIGN	perhaps this should be an exception since it is only ever used in the above method?
DESIGN	note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass! was tounqotedaliasstrings getdiscriminatorcolumnname before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	put a placeholder in entries so we don t recurse back and try to save the same object again. question should this be done before onsave is called? likewise should it be done before onupdate ?
DESIGN	before cascade! todo should this be session.instantiate persister ... ?
DESIGN	todo we should throw an exception if we really know for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new staleobjectstateexception entityname id
DESIGN	todo the order in which entities are saved may matter e.g. a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entities can be saved keep retrying the batch of transient entities until either 1 there are no transient entities left in transientcopycache or 2 no transient entities were saved in the last batch for now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge
DESIGN	todo if object was an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two sql selects
DESIGN	todo put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second level cache needs some extra work
DESIGN	todo not quite sure about the full implications of this!
DESIGN	this is kinda the best we can do...
DESIGN	todo this needn t exclude subclasses...
DESIGN	todo we use two visitors here inefficient!
DESIGN	trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cant handle whitespaces before a in a sp
DESIGN	todo does this really need to be here? does the collection already have it s own up to date snapshot?
DESIGN	otherwise a trim specification and or a trim character have been specified we need to decide which options are present and do the right thing should leading trim characters be trimmed? should trailing trim characters be trimmed? the trim character the trim source
DESIGN	it is possible that the tree walking in outerjoinloader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known this temporary solution assumes that the property ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to a reasonable guess todo fix this add outerjoinloadable.getsubclasspropertytablename string propertyname
DESIGN	todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it hasn t then return collection.getowner
DESIGN	i suppose?
DESIGN	tbd should this be varbinary 1 ? registercolumntype types.varbinary binary 1
DESIGN	shortcut
DESIGN	todo we should provide some way to get keys of collection of statistics to make it easier to retrieve from a gui perspective
DESIGN	todo probably better to calculate these and pass them in as it ll be more performant
DESIGN	todo should we additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	todo simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
DESIGN	todo is there really any reason to kkeep trying if this fails once?
DESIGN	todo not sure this is correct could not find docs on how to do this.
DESIGN	hsql has no blob clob support .... but just put these here for now!
DESIGN	merges don t cascade to uninitialized collections todo perhaps this does need to cascade after all....
DESIGN	yick! need this for proper serialization deserialization handling...
DESIGN	todo should orphans really be deleted during lock???
DESIGN	todo move to stringhelper?
DESIGN	sets can be just a view of a part of another collection. do we need to copy it to be sure it won t be changing underneath us? ie. this.set.addall set
DESIGN	todo it would be really really nice to use this to also model components!
DESIGN	todo move to .sql package!!
DESIGN	todo look at the owning property and check that it isn t lazy by instrumentation
DESIGN	todo add this info to the translator and aggregate it here...
DESIGN	todo possibly relax that
DESIGN	would be better to use the element type to determine whether the old and the new are equal here the problem being we do not necessarily have access to the element type in all cases
DESIGN	todo code duplication with joinedsubclassentitypersister
DESIGN	todo refactor to .sql package
DESIGN	todo two hashmap lookups here is one too many...
DESIGN	note that this method could easily be moved up to basicentitypersister if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
DESIGN	from the collection of associations locate oja for the manytoone corresponding to this persister to fully define the many to many we need that oja so that we can use its alias here todo is there a better way here?
DESIGN	todo this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package ... add a criteriaimplementor interface
DESIGN	do we need to qualify index names with the schema name?
DESIGN	todo we probably should have a statisticsnotpublishedexception to make it clean
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of this package!
DESIGN	yukky! don t you have subclasses for that! todo race conditions can happen here
DESIGN	note very hackish workaround!! todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
DESIGN	todo need to make the majority of this functionality into a top level support class for custom impl support
DESIGN	for dom4j collections only todo it would be better if this was done at the higher level by printer
DESIGN	todo inefficient if that cache is just going to ignore the updated state!
DESIGN	todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it hasn t then get the id from collection.getowner
DESIGN	todo refactor make this method private
DESIGN	todo keep seperate notions of qt here for shallow non shallow queries...
DESIGN	todo temporary needed because currently persister is the one that creates and renders the join fragments for inheritence hierarchies...
DESIGN	this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call stop
DESIGN	swaldman 2004 02 07 modify to allow null values to signify fall through to c3p0 poolconfig defaults
DESIGN	work around that crazy issue where the tree contains empty fromelements no text afaict this is caused by fromelementfactory.createcollectionjoin
DESIGN	kinda ugly but needed for collections with a . node mapping
DESIGN	fixme get the persistentclass
DESIGN	todo would be great to have a mapping hasnonidentifierpropertynamedid method i don t believe that mapping getreferencedpropertytype accounts for the identifier property so if it returns for a property named id then we should have a non id field named id
DESIGN	entity name will not be available for non pojo entities todo cache the entity name somewhere so that it is available to this exception
DESIGN	todo is this really necessary????
DESIGN	index getpropertycolumnspan i todo this is kinda slow...
DESIGN	todo move to .sql package and refactor with similar things!
DESIGN	todo i am not so sure about the exception handling in this bit!
DESIGN	ugly little workaround for fact that createuniquekeyloaders does not handle component properties
DESIGN	append the sql to return the generated identifier todo suck into insert
DESIGN	this is really ugly but necessary
DESIGN	todo modify the class definition if not already transformed...
DESIGN	todo should we use select .. for update?
DESIGN	create an action that will evict collection and entity regions based on queryspaces table names .. todo cache the autodetected information and pass it in instead..
DESIGN	todo is this 100 correct?
DESIGN	used only for regression testing!!!! todo obviously get rid of all this junk
DESIGN	note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass! was tounqotedaliasstrings getidentifercolumnnames before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug
DESIGN	todo move into collection type so we can use polymorphism!
DESIGN	todo should we just collect these like with the collections above?
DESIGN	todo should really move this log statement to collectiontype where this is used from...
DESIGN	fixme hacky workaround to jbcache 1202
DESIGN	hum ... should we cascade anyway? throw an exception? fine like it is?
DESIGN	todo this might really even be moved into the cfg package and used as the basis for all things which are configurable.
DESIGN	todo copy paste from insertrows
DESIGN	todo suck into event class
DESIGN	todo never reached since gettypename actually throws an exception!
DESIGN	this is used by sessionfactoryimpl to hand to the generated sessionimpl was the only reason i could see that we cannot just use null as settings.cacheprovider
DESIGN	xmlforest requires a new kind of function constructor
DESIGN	todo i considered validating the presence of the ts cache here but decided to defer unti getquerycacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
DESIGN	todo why not use the timestamp in a dataversion?
DESIGN	todo eventually merge this with treecache and just add optional opt lock support there.
DESIGN	. fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version. should not be necessary.. . param props the configuration properties.
DESIGN	todo i considered validating ts cache config here but decided to defer unti gettimestampscacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
DESIGN	can happen because of the multiple ways cache.remove can be invoked
DESIGN	need to do that here rather than in the save event listener to let the post insert events to have a id filled entity when identity is used ejb3
DESIGN	unhappy about this being public ... is there a better way?
DESIGN	todo safe to interpret map.remove key null as non dirty?
DESIGN	fixme hack to work around fact that calling node added root.addchild fqn doesn t properly set the version on the node
DESIGN	work around the feature where tree cache is validating the inserted node during the next transaction. no idea...
DESIGN	todo is this a valid operation on a timestamps cache?
DESIGN	todo what else to do here?
DESIGN	todo replace this with a more elegant solution.
DESIGN	short cut check...
DESIGN	todo to handle concurrent writes correctly this should return a lock to the client
DESIGN	put has nowait semantics is this really appropriate? note that it needs to be async replication never local or sync
DESIGN	this is ugly here but needed because its a subquery
DESIGN	todo will need reference to session factory to fully complete hhh 1907
DESIGN	yuck!
DESIGN	inheritance cycle detection paranoid check
DESIGN	todo encapsulate the protected instance variables!
DESIGN	polymorphism comment above
DOCUMENTATION	todo find a decent name before documenting
IMPLEMENTATION	add an entry for this type of entity. we can be assured that all referenced entities have already been processed so specify that this entity is with the latest batch. doing the batch number before adding the name to the list is a faster way to get an accurate number.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle typedefs
IMPLEMENTATION	todo native ids
IMPLEMENTATION	todo bindpropertyresults alias returnelem
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle property ref
IMPLEMENTATION	todo validate existing of property with the chosen name. secondpass
IMPLEMENTATION	todo get all properties not just the fetched ones!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo restrict violation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo assertion only could be optimized away
IMPLEMENTATION	todo lowercasing done here. was done at random before maybe not needed at all ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo optimize away this lookup for entities w o unsaved value undefined
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tolowercase was not done before. only used in template.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo arithmetic expressions multiple new foo ...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check that entry.getidentifier .equals requestedid
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not visible to the user!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we limit stored procedures ?!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo formulas ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use these in methods above
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache the persister this shows up in yourkit
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add referencedclass to disambiguate to fks on the same columns pointing to different tables
IMPLEMENTATION	todo create uk loaders for component properties
IMPLEMENTATION	todo still need to make collectionpersisters entitymode aware
IMPLEMENTATION	todo terrible implementation!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo eventually put this back in once we think all is fixed object otheralias columnsunique.put qualifiedcolumn columnalias
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i don t really like this implementation it would be better if this was handled by searchfordirtycollections
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if key contains the owner id
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache this in an instvar
IMPLEMENTATION	todo temporary initial step towards hhh 1907
IMPLEMENTATION	todo remove this once componentmetamodel is complete and merged
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add owner argument!!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle supportsnotnullunique false but such a case does not exist in the wild so far
IMPLEMENTATION	todo better error message since we actually support composites if names are explicitly listed.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo for some dialects it would be appropriate to add the renderorderbypropertiesselect to other select strings
IMPLEMENTATION	todo unnecessary for databases with ansi style joins
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe call it getrowselection ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make this handle multiple collection roles!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo include the rowids!!!!
IMPLEMENTATION	if we are still not resolved we might represent a constant. needed to add this here because the allowance of naked prop refs in the grammar collides with the definition of literals constants nondeterminism . todo cleanup the grammar so that processconstants is always just handled from here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo or should we return containstablealias ??
IMPLEMENTATION	todo look at perhaps caching this...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo avoid this for non new instances where mightbedirty false
IMPLEMENTATION	todo theoretically non threadsafe...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo look at optimizing these...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache this sql...
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo check if mimer sql cannot handle the way db2 does.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if we are using identity columns fetch the identifier
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check there is no actual definition elemnents when a ref is defined
IMPLEMENTATION	table null an association fill it in later todo fill in the mappings for table null
IMPLEMENTATION	todo return new lock ts
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add support for read write nonstrict read write ???
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why aren t these the same?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo proxies!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if we support multiple fetch groups we would need to clone the set of lazy properties!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mappings.getlogicaltablename ownertable
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if lock.gettimestamp .equals ts
IMPLEMENTATION	todo always true for now but not if we later decide to support elements in the from clause

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we should use the current object state ie. after any updates that occurred during flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	might need to run a different filter entirely after the flush because the collection role may have changed

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	or should it actually throw an exception?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	both many to one and one to one are represented as a property. entitypersister is relying on this value to determine lazy fetch groups in terms of field level interception. so we need to make sure that we return true here for the case of many to one and one to one with lazy no proxy impl note lazy no proxy currently forces both lazy and unwrap to be set to true. the other case we are extremely interested in here is that of lazy proxy where lazy is set to true but unwrap is set to false. thus we use both here under the assumption that this return is really only ever used during persister construction to determine the lazy property field fetch groupings. if that assertion changes then this check needs to change as well. partially this is an issue with the overloading of the term lazy here...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we know there is exactly 1 row we can skip. it would be great if we could always skip this it is a problem for key many to one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this can never happen because this rule will always eliminate the child not.. case not . return x.getfirstchild not not x x .

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this has been shown to happen occasionally in rare cases when using a transaction manager transaction timeout where the timeout calls back through hibernate s registered transaction synchronization on a separate reaping thread. in cases where that reaping thread executes through this block at the same time the main application thread does we can get into situations where these cmes occur. and though it is not allowed per se the end result without handling it specifically is infinite looping. so here we simply break the loop

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the new node to the map so that we don t create it twice.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return getfactory .getsettings .getbytecodeprovider .getproxyfactoryfactory .buildproxyfactory
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	oracle driver reports to support getgeneratedkeys but they only support the version taking an array of the names of the columns to be returned via its returning clause . no other driver seems to support this overloaded version.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not final because proxy factory creation can fail
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	register the fromelement with the from clause now that we have the names and aliases.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	superclass entity name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first allow the actual type to control the return value. the actual underlying sqltype could actually be different
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade save to collections after the collection owner was saved

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection.cleardirty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don t need to worry about existing version being uninitialized because this block isn t called by a re entrant load re entrant loads always have lock mode none
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note this affects the return value!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	istransactioncallbackregistered denotes whether any hibernate transaction has registered as a callback against this jdbccontext only one such callback is allowed. directly serializing this value causes problems with jdbctransaction or really any transaction impl where the callback is local to the transaction instance itself since that transaction is not serialized along with the jdbccontext. thus we handle that fact here explicitly...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note evict operates locally only i.e. does not propogate to any other nodes in the potential cluster . this is exactly what is needed when we destroy here destroy is used as part of the process of shutting down a sessionfactory thus these removals should not be propogated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate the inner join the elements need to be joined to the collection they are in.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise perform a deep equivalence check...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	might happen with a managed connection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to account for allowable within the variant

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don t need to worry about any condition in the on clause here tofromfragmentstring since anything in the on condition is already applied to the whole query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	re snapshot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the difficulty here is exactly what do we update in order to force the version to be incremented in the db...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for convenience to save some lookups
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	regions can get instantiated in the course of normal work e.g. a named query region will be created the first time the query is executed so suspend any ongoing tx
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note this is not updated when properties are fetched lazily!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an ident node can represent an index expression if the ident represents a naked property ref note this makes the assumption which is currently the case in the hql sql grammar that the ident is first resolved itself addrexpr resolve . the other option if that changes is to call resolve from here but it is currently un needed overhead.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for an explicit many to many relationship add a second join from the intermediate many to many table to the destination table. also make sure that the from element s idea of the destination is the destination table.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should not happen since the dtd prevents it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to parse off the column qualifiers this is assuming which is true as of now that this is only used from update and delete hql statement parsing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the current join represents the join between a many to many association table and its target table. here we need to apply any additional filters defined specifically on the many to many
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the from element represents a join fragment and it is a theta style join convert its type from join fragment to from fragment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check basic level one nullablilty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add a zero or quite low timeout option so we don t block. ignore any timeoutexception. basically we forego caching the query result in order to avoid blocking. reads are done with suspended tx so they should not hold the lock for long. not caching the query result is ok since any subsequent read will just see the old result with its out of date timestamp that result will be discarded and the db query performed again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	values is not null and is checkable we ll look deeper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	possibly handle something parameters for the query ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for non null args check for components and elements containing components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we want to handle it bidirectional and detached we also need to load this collection with an eager outer join fetch this time with criteria and not hql
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	public propertyprojection project . return projections.property getpropertyname .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	persistent collections may have components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have the jbcwritemutex so no other local thread will be trying to write this key. it s possible here some remote thread has come in and changed the values again but since we are reading the values to write to jbc right now we know we are writing the latest values i.e. we don t assume that what we cached in entry.update above is what we should write to jbc now . our write could be redundant i.e. we are writing what some remote thread just came in an wrote. there is a chance that yet another remote thread will update us and we ll then overwrite that later data in jbc. but all remote nodes will ignore that change in their localcache the only place it will live will be in jbc where it can only effect the initial state transfer values on newly joined nodes i.e. populatelocalcache .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	registercolumntype types.varchar 16777215 mediumtext
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ident might be the name of a class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we don t want to suspend the tx. if we do 1 we might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes. no tx no wl on cache node so other threads can prematurely see those query results 2 no tx immediate replication. more overhead plus we spread issue 1 above around the cluster
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	todo!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for regression testing against output from the old parser... found it easiest to simply reorder the fromelements here into ascending order in terms of injecting them into the resulting sql ast in orders relative to those expected by the old parser this is definitely another of those only needed for regression purposes . the syntheticandfactory then simply injects them as it encounters them.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache this
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for a subquery the alias to use depends on a few things we already know this is not an overall select 1 if this from element represents a correlation to the outer most query a if the outer query represents a multi table persister we need to use the given alias in anticipation of one of the multi table executors being used as this subquery will actually be used in the id select phase of that multi table executor b otherwise we need to use the persister s table name as the column qualification 2 otherwise not correlated use the given alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only really need new array during semiresolve!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classic translator does not support collection of ordinal param metadata
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unwrap it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache the hashcode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an unfetched association can only point to an entity that already exists in the db
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we work under the following assumptions valid cases 1 datetime something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions 2 datetime datetime always results in a double 3 datetime something other than datetime always results in a datetime db will catch invalid conversions invalid cases 4 datetime datetime 5 something other than datetime datetime 6 datetime any type 7 datetime any type 8 any type datetime doing so allows us to properly handle parameters as either the left or right side here in the majority of cases

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	safe from concurrent modification because of how entrylist is implemented on identitymap
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	transform the tree.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	parse the query string into an hql ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	so this needs to be safe from concurrent modification problems. it is safe because of how identitymap implements entryset
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only needed during compilation phase...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	update the status of the object and if necessary schedule an update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	schedule updates to collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity inserts updates in order to account for bidi associations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database has changed now so the subselect results need to be invalidated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the collection is dereferenced remove from the session cache iter.remove does not work since the entryset is not backed by the set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 1 parse the hql into an ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	key is an entity involved with the operation performed by the listener value is a flag indicating if the listener explicitly operates on the entity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get a snapshot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	public final currency getcurrency int col throws hibernateexception . return currency get col .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	right represents a joins originating from left...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the query is already compiled skip the compilation.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remember that ordinal parameters numbers are 1 based!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	overriden to avoid system.exit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	all clear
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore the token class name parameter and use a specific token class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	early exit!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before any callbacks etc so subdeletions see that this deletion happened first
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ensures that containing deletions happen before sub deletions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade delete to collections before the collection owner is deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade delete to many to one after the parent was deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is an initialized proxy let cascade handle it later on
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assign the requested id to the proxy before reassociating the proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an uninitialized proxy noop don t even need to return an id since it is never a save
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize properties of the event
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the id in the event object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	transient or deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume this is a newly instantiated transient object which should be saved rather than updated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a transient object with existing persistent state not loaded by the session
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check two adjecent nodes at the top of the from clause tree
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cachedstate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a detached collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the collection belonged to a different entity clean up the existing state of the collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	log.debug calling onload
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note performexecutions clears all collectionxxxxtion collections the collection actions in the session
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. the entity came in from update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to check even if it was not initialized because of delayed adds!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if template is null we just write the function out as it appears in the hql statement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	semantic action processing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find any entities that are still transient after retry
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize sql nodes here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check the persistence context for an entry relating to this entity to be merged...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the unresolved path in this node and the parent. set the text for the parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	60 second lock timeout
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. property prop new property prop.setname id . prop.setpropertyaccessorname embedded prop.setvalue id . entity.setidentifierproperty prop .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	continue... we ll find out if it ends up not getting saved later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that entity id requestedid
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not a collection? return the entity property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection of many to any mappings... used to circumvent the component collection check below...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise the destination node was implied by the from clause and the from clause processor will automatically add it in the right place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the first identifier in the path referrs to the class alias not the class name then this is a correlated subselect. if it s a correlated sub select use the existing table alias. otherwise generate a new one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	origin.adddestination destination add the query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reset the node type because the rest of the system is expecting from fragment all we wanted was for the factory to create the right sub class. this might get reset again later on anyway to make the sql generation simpler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	explicit true this is an explict select. arraylist sqlresulttypelist new arraylist
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlresulttypelist.add type generate the select expression.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the expression list has exactly one expression and the type of the expression is a collection then this might be a collection function such as index c or size c .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the uber rule here is that we need to include subclass joins if the fromelement is in any way dereferenced by a property from the subclass table otherwise we end up with column references qualified by a non existent table reference in the resulting sql...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before cascade!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade first so that all unsaved objects get their copy created before we actually copy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	copyvalues works by reflection so explicitly mark the entity instance dirty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression in the list of nested subexpressions we are currently processing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no need to even collect this information if the persister is considered multi table
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as soon as we encounter our first letter return the substring from that position
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	retrieve the value of the designated column in the current row of this resultset object as a java.io.reader object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays replaceelements may return a different reference since the array length might not match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not be able to reach last without maxposition being set unless there are no results
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not use proxiesbykey since not all proxies that point to this session s instances are in that collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should be a call to resolve not resolveidentifier cos it might be a property ref and we did not cache the referenced value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we have tt not found ignore tt association mapped to a formula we always need to dirty check it so we can update the second level cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we now have the value of the property ref we reference. however we need to dig a little deeper as that property might also be an entity type in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	true if this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role otherwise this is a collectioninitializer and we are loading up a single collection or batch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this method should be implemented assuming it s valid to do start stop start leave state appropriate for another start
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we don t want to waste effort setting an option if jbc is already in local mode. if jbc is repl a sync then check if they passed an config option to disable query replication
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see if we had a 2nd invalidation from the same initial preinvalidation timestamp. if so only increment if the new current value is an increase
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the workspace node has null as well ok if not we ve been modified in a non comparable manner which we have to treat as us being newer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	maintain correct duplication if loaded in a cartesian product
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datasource unpooled datasources.unpooleddatasource . jdbcurl props.getproperty environment.user props.getproperty environment.pass .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don t need to lock the cache here since if someone else inserted the same pk first the insert would fail
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to grab the version value from the entity otherwise we have issues with generated version entities that may have multiple actions queued during the same flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	short circuit s no new elements the old list contains only orphans no old elements so no orphans neither
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test out the optimizer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the updated snapshot of the entity state by cloning current state it is safe to copy in place since by this time no one else should have has a reference to the array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	!persister.iscacheinvalidationrequired
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the existing pool flag to true
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have created the pool ourselves so shut it down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the load which takes an entity does not pass an entityname
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note expected in the syntax type listenerclass sep type listenerclass where sep is any whitespace or comma
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tree cache in optimistic mode seems to have as very difficult time with remove calls on non existent nodes npes ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we ignore minimalputoverride. jbosscache putforexternalread is already about as minimal as we can get it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing for persistent instances
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimisticcache impl
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	option.setdataversion nonlockingdataversion.instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume true since we don t really know and it doesn t matter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	show the modified ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize dirty flags for arrays collections with composite elements and reset reached doupdate etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the dot node about the join type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this dot expression now refers to the resulting from element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	among other things updatereachables will recursively load all collections that are moving roles. this might cause entities to be loaded.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	post flushing section
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise recreate the mapping between the collection and its key
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create a parameter specification for the collection filter...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	attach any mapping defined order by fragments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we found some extends attributes referencing entities which were not already processed. here we need to locate all entity names and class names contained in this document itself making sure that these get removed from the extendz list such that only extends names which require us to delay processing i.e. external to this document and not yet processed are contained in the returned result
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure that the persister is versioned
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for native sql queries the param metadata is determined outside any relation to a query plan because query plan creation and or retreival for a native sql query depends on all of the return types having been set which might not be the case up front when param metadata would be most useful
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this function has a template redirect output and catch the arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the id assigned to the instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no array holder we found an unwrappered array this can t occur because we now always call wrap before getting to here return ah null ? true searchfordirtycollections ah type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the data type is not an association type it could not have been in the from clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to generate ids as part of this bulk insert. note that this is only supported for sequence style generators and post insert style generators basically only in db generators
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first look for a reference to a projection alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there are no collection fetches then no further checks are needed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	commented out by inspection 12 11 04 10 56 am int getwarningcount
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if a threadlocalsessioncontext bound session happens to get serialized to be completely correct we need to make sure that unbinding of that session occurs.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure no alias is applied to the table name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	delegate to the queryloader...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not actually propogate antlrexceptions as a cause so log it here for diagnostic purposes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the explicitly declared select expression determine the return types indicated by each select token
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	select clauses for insert statements should alwasy be treated as shallow
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	after that process the joins. invoke a delegate to do the work as this is farily complex.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache impl
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	simple cache of param metadata based on query string. ideally the original user supplied query string should be used to retreive this metadata i.e. not the para list expanded query string to avoid unnecessary cache entries. used solely for caching param metadata for native sql queries see getsqlparametermetadata for a discussion as to why...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	alias references and identifiers use the same node class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	these are just two unrelated table references
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again both should be fromelements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check a set of parent child nodes in the from clause tree to determine if a comma is required between them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 2 analyze the hql ast and produce an sql ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 3 generate the sql.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise we have a non scalar select with defined collection fetch es . make sure that there is only a single root entity in the return no tuples
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	paramtranslations new parametertranslationsimpl collectedparameterspecifications
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are already processing a dot structure
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should mean that no such property was found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	was there an explicit select expression?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resolve everything up to this dot but don t resolve the placeholders yet.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not not between a b between a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just add a not parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first save off the pertinent ids as the return value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if the connection is in auto commit mode no connection means aggressive connection release outside a jta transaction context so must be autocommit mode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first save off the pertinent ids saving the number of pertinent ids for return
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	start performing the deletes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don t forget to resolve the argument! resolve the collection function now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise everything ok.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	re arrange the tree so that the collection function is the root and the lhs is the path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected regionrootlistener listener
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inject the where after the parent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	never include subclasses for implied from elements.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	establish the region root node with a non locking data version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for pessimistic locking we just want to toss out our ref to any old invalid root node and get the latest may be null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the rest only matters for optimistic locking where we need to establish the proper data version on the region root
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this dot has already been resolved stop now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the property is another class..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise this is a primitive type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	foo.bars.size also handles deprecated stuff like foo.bars.maxelement for backwardness
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for timestamps we default to a separate config
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimistic lock all include all updatable properties optimistic lock dirty include all properties we are updating this time
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this property belongs to the table and it is not specifically excluded from optimistic locking by optimistic lock false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	information about properties of this class including inherited properties only really needed for updatable insertable properties
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated. for partial component generation we currently just re select the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note addduplicatealias already performs nullness checks on the alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the from clauses are the same we can be a little more aggressive in terms of what we reuse
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again null ! null here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise subquery case dont reuse the fromelement if we are processing the from clause of the subquery
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the lhs hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the referenced node text is the special id
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only the identifier property field name can be a reference to the associated entity s pk...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special shortcut for id properties skip the join! this must only occur at the end of a path expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	append the new property name onto the unresolved path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the destination fromelement to includesubclasses .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the lhs is a collection use collectionpropertymapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don t resolve the node again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	lists arrays sets maps bags
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have something like ? op rhs
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	configure the cache to use our tm
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure jbc doesn t look one up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we finish all the removes first to take care of possible unique constraints and so that we can take better advantage of batching
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a combination of foreign key columns and pk columns since the ordering of removal and addition is not guaranteed when a child moves from one parent to another
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure we don t re release the same cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we use a different delegate than the non optimistic superclass default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have something like lhs op ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don t create a unique key cos some databases don t like a uk on nullable columns getcollectiontable .createuniquekey getidentifier .getconstraintcolumns
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isset collection.isset issorted collection.issorted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the rhs hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if jbc is using invalidation we don t want to propagate changes. we use the timestamps cache to manage invalidation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	don t hold the jbc node lock throughout the tx as that prevents updates add a zero or low timeout option so we don t block waiting for tx s that did a put to commit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double check the distributed cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get an exclusive right to update jbc for this key from this node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one or the other needs to be a datetime for us to get into this method in the first place...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the condition to the join sequence that qualifies the indexed element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sometimes use the element table alias sometimes use the... umm... collection table alias many to many
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now set the text for this node. it should be the element columns.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the function return value type based on the type of the first argument.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this will call initialize tok !
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	mutation depends on the types of nodes invloved...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generated select expressions are already resolved nothing to do.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the path may be a reference to an alias defined in the parent query.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the hql class alias refers to the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	associate the table alias with the element.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure the lhs is assignable ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	false indicates to not generate parens around the assignment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	currently allowed...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in non select queries the only time we should need to join is if we are in a subquery from clause
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return classalias null ? classname classalias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is an explicit from element.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to wrtap the param in a cast
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since this is an explicit from element it can t be implied in the from clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing eplicit from elements are always in the projection list.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	propertyname refers to something like collection.size...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	property name is a sub path of a component...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always add the collection s query spaces.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we are inside a new result but not inside a nested function
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invokeinterface invoke callback.read each type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special case
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the name of an sql function
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is basically a copy paste of orderbyparser ... might be worth refactoring
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	select p from p in class eg.person group by p.name p.address p
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return aliases not supported in classic translator!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	register collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just do the regular thing if you can t find the ctor your ast must have default ctor to use this.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the keyword used to specify an identity column if identity column key generation is supported.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	.getelementpropertymapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	dup
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	following doesn t handle null not null but unnecessary since this would mean all rows
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checkcast
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	crossjoins.add name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie no select clause in hql
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invokeinterface enabled.getinterceptfieldcallback
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ifnonnull label1
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are the lhs of the dot representing a naked comp prop ref
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	load 1

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	char
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	short
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classic parser does not support bulk manipulation statements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can t cache this stuff either per invocation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the legacy behaviour for hql queries...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reference type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not known!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need this since join condition can appear inside parens!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	float
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	bad type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	boolean byte char int short
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	expressionopeners.add deliberately excluded
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	skip finalize methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	mainly for oscache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	decrement the lock
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	recache the updated state
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	null clientlock is remotely possible but will never happen in practice
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	by requiring we rely on lock timeout in the case of an unsuccessful update!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the user provided resulttransformer not the one used with select new . here to avoid mangling transformed non transformed results.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	disassemble positional parameters
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. 60 seconds
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise a trim specification and or a trim character have been specified we need to decide which options are present and do the right thing should leading trim characters be trimmed? should trailing trim characters be trimmed? the trim character what is to be trimmed off? the trim source from where should it be trimmed?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	noop
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is called from settingsfactory irregardless trivial to simply disregard
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing subclasses may override.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inside a between ... and ... expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	were an odd or even number of nots encountered the join string built up by compound paths inside this expression a flag indicating if the subexpression is known to be boolean
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. a many to many
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cope with
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cope with a continued path expression ie. .baz
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note early return
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cope with a subselect
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the id value of a newly instantiated instance as the unsaved value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	close extra brackets we opened
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	take note when this is a boolean expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	persister.setidentifier result id before calling interceptor for consistency with normal load
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	joinprocessor needs to know if the where clause fragment came from a dynamic filter or not so it can put the where clause fragment in the right place in the sql ast. hasfiltercondition keeps track of that fact.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no op ccs did not have such a concept
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assumes that types are all of span 1
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again ccs did not have such a concept however a reasonable proximity is to clear the cache. for non transaction aware caches we will also do a clear at the end of the transaction
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	process a token mapping oo path expressions to sql expressions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	open any extra brackets we might need.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cope with special cases of and not
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the next one up must also be

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cannot instantiate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	start by looking for hql keywords...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inner joins can be abbreviated to join
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	outer is optional and is ignored
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now anything that is not a hql keyword
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	process the old hql style where aliases appear first ie. using the in or in class constructions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	treat it as a classname
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	treat it as a path expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	starts with a path expression new style

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle quoted strings
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	version timestamp
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is either a version tag with no type attribute or a timestamp tag

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to dirty check collections since they can cause an owner version number increment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	select before update

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first element of array is reserved for the actual instance we are loading!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	keep the behavior consistent even for boundary usages

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	look for the instance by uuid
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for a dynamic class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test this entity to see if we must query it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note early exit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for backward compatability
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must add to jndi after adding to hashmaps because some jndi servers use serialization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	look for existing collection as part of the persistence context
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure this is a defined parameter and check the incoming value type

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for an any we will have to use reflection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only collections belonging to deleted entities are allowed to be dereferenced in the case of orphan delete
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it was previously unreferenced we need to flush in order to get its state into the database in order to execute query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not for internal use
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise we only need to flush if there are in memory changes to the queried tables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	aload 0
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is initialized see if the underlying instance is contained since we need to account for the fact that it might have been evicted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	stops flush being called multiple times if this method is recursively called

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a collection loaded in the current session can not possibly be the collection belonging to the entity passed to update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle empty collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle empty collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else this is not a collection initializer and empty collections will be detected by looking for the owner s identifier in the result set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finally what it s all about...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we do not bother with the discriminator.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	validate instances of validatable
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	null version means the object is in the process of being loaded somewhere else in the resultset
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	problematic for key many to one !

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	disable a join back to this same association
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note unlike all other loaders this one is not multithreaded or cacheable!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the user visible aliases which are unknown to the superclass these are not the actual physical sql aliases

DEFECT	technically incorrect here we need to wrap null values as bsh.primitive.null. however the this.invokemethod will do that much for us. we need to generate a conditional here to test for null and return primitive.null
DEFECT	very subtle... if we leave this for ensurephysicallineisvisible an extra line will be added to the scroll line count.

DEFECT	broken class
DEFECT	while its broken to have a null symlinkpath some older plugins might...
DEFECT	this is not good... need a way to update eval without re installing... so that we can re eval params etc. when classloader changes look into this
DEFECT	this seems to make nested readlock calls work okay. but i have no idea if it actually fixes things or not.
DEFECT	... but if hypersearch results window is floating the workaround causes problems!

DEFECT	warning null callstack here. don t think we need a stack trace to indicate how we sourced the method.
DEFECT	this class is not very fast...
DEFECT	. note this method incorrectly caches the method structure. it needs to. be cleared when the classloader changes..
DEFECT	xxx action bar might not be temp
DEFECT	i wonder if the lack of this broke anything in the past?
DESIGN	. implement string value . according to the jls value may be anything.. in beanshell we ll disallow void undefined values.. or should we map them to the empty string? .
DESIGN	this should be before dockables are initialized
DESIGN	is this right?
DESIGN	should we do this for both cases above?
DESIGN	need to loosen this to any throwable... do we need to handle that in interpreter somewhere? check first...
DESIGN	. note this implementation is temporary. we currently keep a flat. namespace of the base name of classes. i.e. beanshell cannot be in the. process of defining two classes in different packages with the same. base name. to remove this limitation requires that we work through. namespace imports in an analogous or using the same path as regular. class import resolution. this workaround should handle most cases . so we ll try it for now..
DESIGN	i wish i could make this friendly to only namespace
DESIGN	undocumented hack to allow browser actions to work. xxx clean up in 4.3
DESIGN	look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicates that in namespace getcommand is that ok?
DESIGN	this should be per instance
DESIGN	can we use the proxy mechanism to cast a bsh.this to the correct interface?
DESIGN	redundant with constructor
DESIGN	. issues to resolve here.... 1 in which classloader should we define the class?. if there is a bshclassloader should we define it there?. 2 should we use reflection to set it in a non bsh classloader. if there is one or should we always create a bsh classloader. and expose its defineclass ?.
DESIGN	could refactor these a bit
DESIGN	. note this class essentially just delegates most of its methods to its. parent. the setvariable indirection is very small. we could probably. fold this functionality back into the base namespace as a special case.. but this has changed a few times so i d like to leave this abstraction for. now..
DESIGN	simplified these settings a little...
DESIGN	. should check for strict java here and use isjavaassignable instead.
DESIGN	workaround for swing rendering labels starting with html using the html engine
DESIGN	look for a default invoke handler method in the namespace note this code duplicates that in this.java... should it? call on this can never be a command
DESIGN	this method is a nightmare
DESIGN	consoleinterface the interpreter reflexively implements the console interface that it uses. should clean this up by using an inner class to implement the console for us.
DESIGN	case insensitive fs workaround
DESIGN	. wrap nulls.. this is a bit of a cludge to address a deficiency in the class. generator whereby it does not wrap nulls on method delegate. see. class generator.java. if we fix that then we can remove this.. just have to generate the code there. .
DESIGN	check for field on object note could eliminate throwing the exception somehow
DESIGN	xxxx re evaluate this can getsuper work by itself now? if we re a class instance and the parent is also a class instance then super means our parent.
DESIGN	. i wish protected access were limited to children and not also . package scope... i want this to be a singleton implemented by various. children. .
DESIGN	imported full name wasn t found as an absolute class if it is compound try to resolve to an inner class. maybe this should happen in the bshclassmanager?
DESIGN	. can t this be combined with run ?. run seems to have stuff in it for interactive vs. non interactive.... compare them side by side and see what they do differently aside from the. exception handling..
DESIGN	copy and paste from bsh classpath classmanagerimpl.java...
DESIGN	null value is just a declaration note we might want to keep any existing value here instead of reset
DESIGN	can this be factored out...? should be be adding the l... here instead?
DESIGN	. catch the mismatch and continue to try the next. note this is innefficient should have an . isassignablefrom that doesn t throw .
DESIGN	should use try finally here to pop ns
DESIGN	. note this could be made clearer by adding an inner class for the. cases and an object context for the child traversal..
DESIGN	hack... sticking to first interpreter that resolves this see comments on type instance variable
DESIGN	note incorrect here we are using the hack in bsh class manager that allows lookup by base name. we need to eliminate this limitation by working through imports. see notes in class manager.
DESIGN	. this is the namespace in which the method is set.. it is a back reference for the node which needs to execute under this . namespace. it is not necessary to declare this transient because . we can only be saved as part of our namespace anyway... currently ..
DESIGN	replace this is cocoa api calls later
DESIGN	scripting classes currently requires accessibility this can be eliminated with a bit more work.
DESIGN	this could be static
DESIGN	. thanks to slava pestov of jedit fame for import caching enhancements.. note this class has gotten too big. it should be broken down a bit..
DESIGN	. register an attribute declaration for later retrieval.. format . string type. string default value. int value type. todo do something with attribute types..
DESIGN	. todo . to get cast and boxing working e.g.. e.g. byte ia 1 2 . . if the basetype is a wrapper type then we need to get the . primitive type class for the base type here in order for . the cast to allow it... then boxing will happen naturally in. the array.set .. e.g. integer ia 1 2 .
DESIGN	. note we will ll move this behavior out to a subclass of . namespace but we ll start here..
DESIGN	this is a particularly nasty bit of code that checks for a parameter entity reference but peeks ahead to catch the in parameter entity declarations.
DESIGN	should cache this subject to classloader change message evaluation of the formal parameter simply resolves its type via the specified namespace.. it doesn t modify the namespace.
DESIGN	. notes . it would not be hard to eliminate the use of org.objectweb.asm.type from. this class making the distribution a tiny bit smaller..
DESIGN	fucking gtk look and feel
DESIGN	stupid caret will automatically be incremented
DESIGN	spacing workaround
DESIGN	i don t know of any other way to fix this since invoking this command from a menu results in the focus owner being the menu until the menu goes away.

DESIGN	static methods that operate on compound . separated names i guess we could move these to stringutil someday
DESIGN	. note which of these things should be checked at parse time vs. run time?.

DESIGN	clear name resolvers... don t know if this is necessary.
DESIGN	i m too tired to think of a better way to handle this right now.
DESIGN	hacked bufferiorequest to send vfsupdates in case two stage save is off now...
DESIGN	some other primitive should avoid calling methods on primitive as we do in name can t treat primitive like an object message but the hole is useful right now.
DESIGN	change the parent which was the class static to the class instance we really need to check if we re a static inner class here first... but for some reason java won t show the static modifier on our fake inner classes... could generate a flag field.
DESIGN	this is where checked exceptions piss me off. this method only uses a stringreader which can never throw an exception...
DESIGN	if any subexpressions didn t terminate they don t count todo check if this code ever gets hit
DESIGN	parse pattern into tokens. does anyone know if it s more efficient to use char than a string.charat ? i m assuming so.
DESIGN	. note object is only used here for precondition... get rid of it?.
DESIGN	why both of these?
DESIGN	cut off from parent we must have our own class manager. can t do this in the run command needs to resolve stuff should we do it by default when we create a namespace will no parent of class manager?
DESIGN	. note the bsh command code should probably not be here... we need to. scope it by the namespace that imported the command... so it probably. needs to be integrated into namespace..
DESIGN	this could be smarter...
DESIGN	it was explicitly imported but we don t know what it is. should we throw an error here??
DESIGN	. note we need a form of eval that passes the callstack through....
DESIGN	. primary interpreter set and get variable methods. note these are squeltching errors... should they?.
DESIGN	workaround for jdk bug 4071281 where system.in.available returns too large a value. this bug has been fixed in jdk 1.2.
DESIGN	. somewhat of a hack. if the special fields are visible we re. operating relative to a this type already dissallow further. .this references to prevent user from skipping to things like. super.this.caller.
DESIGN	should clean this up to a single return statement
DESIGN	. implementation notes . . note we may need some synchronization in here. . note on version dependency this base class is jdk 1.1 compatible . however we are forced to use weak references in the full featured. implementation the optional bsh.classpath package to accomodate all of. the fleeting namespace listeners as they fall out of scope. namespaces. must be informed if the class space changes so that they can un cache. names . . p . . perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached. types always perform a light weight check with a counter reference. value and use that to detect changes in the namespace. this puts the . burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times but could eliminate. the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak . references in this package.. p .
DESIGN	. note this impor pattern is becoming common... could factor it out into. an importedobject vector class..
DESIGN	not sure if we should really recurse here for explicitly imported class in parent...
DESIGN	the following two boolean checks were tacked on. this could probably be smoothed out.
DESIGN	. notes . . this is broken. it finds public but less specific methods over. non public but more specific ones.. . findmostspecficmethod needs to be rewritten to eliminate . findaccessiblemethod. we should implement the findmostspecificmethod . that uses the publiconly flag. findmostspecificmethod should also. operate in two passes to give standard java assignable matches priority. over extended bsh type matches..

DESIGN	next version remove this
DESIGN	compatibility kludge for jedit 3.1 and earlier
DESIGN	aha! this is probably the only way to fix this
DESIGN	this is a dirty hack and it relies on the fact that updates for parents are sent before updates for the changed nodes themselves if this was not the case the browser wouldn t be updated properly on delete etc . to avoid causing 1 request errors don t reload directory if request already active
DESIGN	we consume this to work around the bug where a tab window switching activates the menu bar on windows.
DESIGN	i guess translated events do not have the evt field set. so consuming won t work. i don t think this is a problem as. nothing uses translation anyway
DESIGN	this is a hack and really needs to be done better.

DESIGN	fucking gtk look and feel!
DESIGN	hack so that select all does not change current buffer
DESIGN	if an occurence occurs at the. beginning of the selection the. selection start will get moved.. this sucks so we hack to avoid it.
DESIGN	silly bug workaround 8694. if you look at the above code . note that we restore the saved caret position first then. scroll to the saved location. however the caret changing. can itself result in scrolling to a different location than. what was saved and since movecaretposition calls. updatebrackethighlight the bracket highlight s out of. bounds calculation will rely on a different set of physical. first last lines than what we will end up with eventually.. instead of confusing the user with status messages that. appear at random when switching buffers we simply hide the. message altogether.
DESIGN	this is a sloppy hack to fix bug. 677902 hitting return after collapsed. fold . . the idea is that if we extend the range then. the problem described in the bug happends so. if the insert is at the very end of the range. we don t extend it instead we push the. insert into the next range however for this. to work properly we also have to mess with. screen line counts.
DESIGN	need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack to work
DESIGN	xxx if we keep the createclassmanager in getclassmanager then we can axe this?
DESIGN	. note this class is messy. the method and field resolution need to be. rewritten. various methods in here catch nosuchmethod or nosuchfield. exceptions during their searches. these should be rewritten to avoid. having to catch the exceptions. method lookups are now cached at a high . level so they are less important however the logic is messy..

DESIGN	. notes see notes on findmostspecificmethod.. this method should be rolled into findmostspecificmethod..
DESIGN	. note is using signaturekey in this way dangerous? in the pathological. case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of. argument types to an untyped method. maybe we could be smarter about. it by ignoring the types of untyped parameter positions? the method. resolver could return a set of hints for the signature key caching?. . there is also the overhead of creating one of these for every method. dispatched. what is the alternative?.

DESIGN	stupidity
DESIGN	. note this method and resolveexpectedjavafield should be rewritten. to invert this logic so that no exceptions need to be caught. unecessarily. this is just a temporary impl.. return the field or null if not found.
DESIGN	. note we need a singleton here so that things like this this work. and probably a good idea for speed .. . caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect . considering the declaringinterpreter could be different under some. circumstances. case a child interpreter running a source eval . command . however the effect is just that the main interpreter that. executes your script should be the one involved in call backs from java.. . i do not know if there are corner cases where a child interpreter would. be the first to use a this reference in a namespace or if that would. even cause any problems if it did... we could do some experiments. to find out... and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter. basis if we had weak references... we might also look at skipping . over child interpreters and going to the parent for the declaring . interpreter so we d be sure to get the top interpreter..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	1st step as explained above resizing an instruction may require to resize another one which may require to resize yet another one and so on. the first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instructions that need to be resized without modifying the code. this is done by the following fix point algorithm parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than 2 bytes to be stored the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instructions . for each such instruction adds an entry in a copy of the indexes and sizes arrays if this has not already been done in a previous iteration! if at least one entry has been added during the previous step go back to the beginning otherwise stop. in fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of tableswitch and lookupswitch instructions depends on their position in the bytecode because of padding . in order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the number of bytes to be added or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop is finished this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of the method .

DEFECT	return cal.gettimeinmillis preceding code won t work with jdk 1.3
DEFECT	fixme we ve cloned the chart but the dataset s aren t cloned and we should do that
DEFECT	todo not serialized yet
DEFECT	first monday after 1900 cal.gettime .gettime preceding code won t work with jdk 1.3
DEFECT	todo we didn t check the height yet
DESIGN	this may be negative
DESIGN	todo the subplot areas needs to be moved out of the plot into the plot state
DESIGN	todo shift block down to bottom
DESIGN	first determine the size of the chart rendering area... todo workout insets for swt
DESIGN	todo implement properly
DESIGN	todo this must be wrong...
DESIGN	todo we didn t check the width yet
DESIGN	hack to ensure the newly created awt fonts will be rendered with the same height as the swt one
DESIGN	todo shift block right by half
DESIGN	todo shift block over to right
DESIGN	todo find a better localization key
DESIGN	fixme implement this low priority
DESIGN	fixme the xyitemrenderer interface doesn t specify the getannotations method but it should
DESIGN	calculate the adjusted data area taking into account the 3d effect... this assumes that there is a 3d renderer all this 3d effect is a bit of an ugly hack...
DESIGN	todo add constructors for combinations of number and date formatters.
DESIGN	todo move to plot state
DESIGN	to do these annotations only work with xyplot see if it is possible to make contourplot a subclass of xyplot dg
DESIGN	fixme we should really assert a value
DESIGN	todo to be implemented
DESIGN	do we need to update the crosshair values?
DESIGN	todo fix output when this flag is set to true
DESIGN	todo for now we are ignoring the height constraint
DESIGN	todo move the above to the plot state
DESIGN	fixme this code means that it is not possible to use more than one domain axis for the combined plots...
DESIGN	not strictly necessary since the renderer set for the parent plot is not used
DESIGN	end of workaround
DESIGN	todo could change this to itemfillpaint . for backwards compatibility it might require a usefillpaint flag.
DESIGN	todo this attribute should be transferred to the renderer state.
DESIGN	todo in jfreechart 1.2.0 put this method in the categoryitemrenderer interface
DESIGN	todo rotate the image when drawn with horizontal orientation?
DESIGN	fixme this should generate a series change event
DESIGN	fixme the renderer interface doesn t have the drawdomainline method so we have to rely on the renderer being a subclass of abstractxyitemrenderer which is lame
DESIGN	todo by coding the event with some information about what changed in the dataset we could make the recalculation of the interval more efficient in some cases for instance if the change is just an update to a y value then the x interval doesn t need updating ...
DESIGN	the method we want isn t in the categoryitemrenderer interface...
DESIGN	fixme what if value is null on next line?
DESIGN	hack to ensure the newly created swt fonts will be rendered with the same height as the awt one
DESIGN	unused but must return something so while we are at it...
DESIGN	a redraw should not trigger another change event
DESIGN	fixme perhaps we should clone the data list
DESIGN	if we are rendering the values as percentages we need to calculate the total for the current item. unfortunately here we end up repeating the calculation more times than is strictly necessary hopefully i ll come back to this and find a way to add the total s to the renderer state. the other problem is we implicitly assume the dataset has no negative values...perhaps that can be fixed too.
DESIGN	note it would be nice to pre calculate this per series
DESIGN	we assume that all other paint instances implement equals and hashcode ...of course that might not be true but what can we do about it?
DESIGN	fixme use other fields too
DESIGN	all attributes are immutable so we can just return the super.clone fixme in fact the generator itself is immutable so cloning is not necessary
DESIGN	here s a quirk the api has been defined in terms of a plain timeperiod which cannot make use of the timezone and locale specified in the constructor...so we only do the time zone pegging if the period is an instanceof regulartimeperiod
DESIGN	now handle specific plot types and yes i know this is some really ugly code that has to be manually updated any time a new plot type is added i should have written something much cooler but i didn t and neither did anyone else .
DESIGN	todo urlencode?
DESIGN	create entities fixme these methods should be defined
DESIGN	todo revert to svn revision 2469 in jfreechart 1.0.16 multiplegradientpaint s jdk issues todo then change visibility of all darker ... methods except darker paint to private!
DESIGN	todo replace getsize by getbounds ?
DESIGN	todo check threshold
DESIGN	fixme add setbaseitemurlgenerator categoryurlgenerator boolean ?
DESIGN	unused in parent
DESIGN	fixme add setseriesitemurlgenerator int categoryurlgenerator boolean ?
DESIGN	now we handle some special cases yes ugly code alert!
DESIGN	fixme it probably makes sense to allocate an array of 256 colors and lazily populate this array...
DESIGN	todo need to fetch this from localised resources
DESIGN	fixme no getvalueformat method?
DESIGN	here we could probably be a little faster by searching for both indices simultaneously but i ll look at that later if it seems like it matters...
DESIGN	todo complete this
DESIGN	fixme we should really assert a value here
DESIGN	fixme clone the attributed string if it is not null
DESIGN	todo implement this method properly
DESIGN	this may be obsolete not used anywhere
DESIGN	a kludge to make everything work when no rows returned
DESIGN	here we tweak the notify flag on the plot so that only one notification happens even though we update multiple axes...
DESIGN	report this?
DESIGN	todo shift block down by half
DESIGN	todo is this a good idea?
DESIGN	fixme better ask the renderer instead of datasetutilities
DESIGN	todo implement the entity for the annotation
DESIGN	todo this needs to move into the renderer state
DESIGN	needs to be improved !!!
DESIGN	not used by plot
DESIGN	fixme this attribute is never used deprecate?
DESIGN	fixme need a locale as well as a timezone
DESIGN	todo implement this properly
DESIGN	todo for jfreechart 1.2.0 this method should go in the shapeutilities class
DESIGN	we ll have to use the method in the interface but this doesn t have the paint and stroke settings...
DESIGN	todo it might be a good idea to keep a reference to the color specified in setpaint or setcolor rather than creating a new object every time getpaint is called.
DESIGN	defer argument checking
DESIGN	fixme check that there isn t already a series with the same key
DESIGN	i know it s bad to create object. better idea?
DESIGN	fixme clone generator
DESIGN	todo use a generator here
DESIGN	fixme this attribute is not used deprecate?
DESIGN	defer argument checking...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i think we need to make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the paint instances are always immutable so they re ok
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme draw outliers
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i think we need to make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the stroke instances are always immutable so they re ok
IMPLEMENTATION	. returns a string representing the week e.g. week 9 2002 . . . todo look at internationalisation. . . return a string representing the week. .
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme show a dialog with the error
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add serialization support for images
IMPLEMENTATION	could make this configurable
IMPLEMENTATION	todo see if we need to apply some line color and style to the axis traces
IMPLEMENTATION	todo draw the interval marker with a 3d effect
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme implement this...
IMPLEMENTATION	. an annotation that allows an image to be placed at some location on . an link xyplot . . . todo implement serialization properly image is not serializable . .

DEFECT	todo we loose encoding information here fix it
DEFECT	todo numeric.new works in ruby and it does here too. however trying to use that instance in a numeric operation should generate an argumenterror. doing this seems so pathological i do not see the need to fix this now.
DEFECT	todo adding implicit nils caused multiple problems in compiler revist after landing assert bodynode ! null bodynode is not null
DEFECT	todo take bigdecimal.mode into account.
DEFECT	fixme for some reason this dispatcher causes a verifyerror... classclass.dispatcher callbackfactory.createdispatcher classclass
DEFECT	fixme i doubt any of the constants referenced in this method are ever redefined should compare to the known values rather than do an expensive constant lookup.
DEFECT	todo rewriter and compiler assume case when empty expression. in mri this is just a when. assert casenode ! null casenode is not null
DEFECT	xxx wrong but will have to do for now
DEFECT	important receive the block argument before the opt and splat args this is so that the arg can be encoded as rest of the array . this won t work if the block argument hasn t been received yet!
DEFECT	fixme i got a bunch of npes when i didn t check for nulls here...how?!
DEFECT	sss fixme there are also differences in variable scoping between 1.8 and 1.9 ruby 1.8 is the buggy semantics if i understand correctly. the semantics of how this shadows other variables outside the block needs to be figured out during live var analysis.
DEFECT	this was a getopt with one mandatory arg but it did not work so i am parsing it for now.
DEFECT	this is the result of a bug that left off all trailing arguments. e.g. system ls 1 dir would be seen as system ls
DEFECT	todo we overflow on large files...we could increase to long to limit this but then the impl gets more involved since java io apis based on int means we have to chunk up a long into a series of int ops .
DEFECT	if we outgrow our pushback stack then grow it this should only happen in pretty pathological cases .
DEFECT	fixme arg may also be true false and nil and still be valid. strangely enough protocol conversion is not happening in ruby on this arg?
DEFECT	todo proper sign
DEFECT	todo in mri 1.9 an explicit check for negative length is added here. indexerror is raised when length is negative. see ruby core 12953 for more details. new note this is actually under re evaluation see ruby core 17483 .
DEFECT	fixme if we terminate immediately this appears to break while in method arguments we need to push a nil for the cases where we will never enter the body
DEFECT	the following constants capture pre known static call sites jruby implementations of methods of ruby classes sss fixme note that compiler impl basebodycompiler is using op match2 for match and and op match for match2 ... is this a bug there?
DEFECT	sss fixme this doesn t preserve original order of when clauses. we could consider preserving the order or maybe not since we would have to sort the constants first in any case for outputing jump tables in certain situations. add body to map for emitting later
DEFECT	sss fixme why is the for node being built using closures and not as a regular loop with branches? this has implications on inlining implementations of closures next break etc. when each and the block it consumes are inlined together in the caller the loop from the each should become a normal loop without any closures. but in this implementation of for we replace one closure with another!
DEFECT	synchronized method per jruby 1173 unsafe double checked locking fixme synchronization is still wrong in cp code
DEFECT	vulture thread will periodically expunge dead entries. entries are also expunged during put operations this is designed to cover the case where many objects are created initially followed by limited put activity. fixme disabled below pending resolution of finalization issue
DEFECT	fixme we are assuming that original string will be raw bytes. if ku is provided this will not be true but that is ok for now. deal with that when someone needs it.
DEFECT	todo rubicon testkernel dies without this line. a cursory glance implies we falsely set ! to nil and this sets it back to something valid. this should get fixed at the same time we address bug 1296484.
DEFECT	mri 1.8 behavior this combination of flags is not allowed
DEFECT	zero args with block fixme omit args index subtract one from normal block index
DEFECT	fixme it may be possible to killpg on systems which support it. posix library needs to tell whether a particular method works or not
DEFECT	todo this code effectively disables all inspection based optimizations none of them are 100 safe yet
DEFECT	fixme no argument seems to work for k in mri plus this should not siphon off additional args jruby k scripts foo . also better error processing.
DEFECT	we are in eval with binding break out early fixme this is broken with the new backtrace stuff
DEFECT	fixme this is a system error based on errno
DEFECT	todo make sure it s really safe to not to copy it
DEFECT	fixme not correct exception
DEFECT	fixme we can t guarantee this will always be a rubyio...so the old code here is not safe
DEFECT	dump the trace and continue this is currently only here for android which seems to have bugs in its enumeration logic http code.google.com p android issues detail?id 2812
DEFECT	fixme add at exit and finalizers to exit then make exit bang not call those.
DEFECT	todo need to isolate the current thread from class creation
DEFECT	xxx actually only on windows...
DEFECT	enebo should frogger foo work it doesnt in linux ruby ?
DEFECT	fixme can t use static would interfere with other runtimes in the same jvm
DEFECT	todo anything threads attached to original fd are notified of the close... see rb thread fd close
DEFECT	todo this is an freopen in mri this is close but not quite the same
DEFECT	todo ruby locks the string here
DEFECT	fixme check how ruby 1.9 handles this
DEFECT	todo full precision divmod is 1000x slower than mri!
DEFECT	fixme i m not sure this is right but the old code returned the undef which definitely isn t right...
DEFECT	enebo very wrong
DEFECT	fixme mri has special case for constants here
DEFECT	fixme throw the right argumenterror s if the class is missing or if it s a module.
DEFECT	todo we should use implicit nil for body but problem punt til later
DEFECT	. get value from current scope or one of its captured scopes.. . fixme block variables are not getting primed to nil so we need to null check those. until we prime them properly. also add assert back in.. . param offset zero indexed value that represents where variable lives. param depth how many captured scopes down this variable should be set. return the value here.
DEFECT	fixme x flag not supported case x break
DEFECT	fixme this is causing a verification error for some reason nilclass.dispatcher callbackfactory.createdispatcher nilclass
DEFECT	walk up the scope tree right now as much as possible to avoid run time walking sss fixme any reason why this might break in the presence of ruby s dynamic resolution? what might break?
DEFECT	fixme errno descriptions from constantine on windows are not useful at the moment.
DEFECT	fixme this should reset to what it was before
DEFECT	sss fixme incorect!
DEFECT	fixme vulture daemon thread prevents finalization find alternative approach. vulture.start
DEFECT	fixme this seems like a good assertion but it breaks compiled code and the code seems to run without it... assert currentmodule ! null can t push null rubyclass
DEFECT	sss fixme for constant arrays we should never get here!
DEFECT	fixme this is wrong
DEFECT	fixme may need to broaden for ipv6 ip address strings
DEFECT	todo sys fail
DEFECT	are there are available data flow facts to run this problem? sss fixme silly optimization?
DEFECT	sss fixme verify semantics of this instruction
DEFECT	fixme this isn t quite right it shouldn t evaluate the value if it s going to throw the error
DEFECT	todo full precision remainder is 1000x slower than mri!
DEFECT	fixme broken but behaving
DEFECT	todo don t require pop
DESIGN	we basically ignore protocol. let someone report it...
DESIGN	fixme i use a for block to implement end node because we need a proc which captures its enclosing scope. forblock now represents these node and should be renamed.
DESIGN	sss fixme 1. is the ordering correct? poll before next
DESIGN	we use a highly uncommon string to represent the paragraph delimiter 100 soln not worth it
DESIGN	add a self recv here todo is this right?
DESIGN	todo mri behavior call or add depending on the call. but this leads to exceptions when floats are added. see http blade.nagaokaut.ac.jp cgi bin scat.rb ruby ruby core 17374 return callcoerced context op b true this is mri behavior. we ll use ours for now thus providing an ability to add floats.
DESIGN	sss fixme is this correctly placed ... at the end of the loop iteration?
DESIGN	todo ruby reuses this logic for other write behavior by checking if it s an io and calling write again
DESIGN	sss fixme where does this go? m.setlineposition arraynode.getposition
DESIGN	it would be nice and logical! if exponent form behaved like e e and decimal form behaved like f but no such luck. hence
DESIGN	sss fixme these should get normally compiled or initialized some other way ... sss fixme parent super type info is incorrect! these are just placeholders for now .. this needs to be updated with real class objects later!
DESIGN	sss fixme i could make ir loop a scope too ... semantically it is a scope but functionally not sure if this is required yet ...
DESIGN	this covers the rare case of lower case class names and thus will fail 99.999 of the time . fortunately we ll only do this once per package name. and seriously folks look into best practices...
DESIGN	sss fixme should this be a string literal or a string? dummy class for the script
DESIGN	todo should this be deprecated ? to be efficient internals should deal with rubyhash directly
DESIGN	sss fixme does int suffice or do we need long?
DESIGN	modules are included with a shim class we must find that shim to handle super appropriately
DESIGN	reset value map if this instruction is the start end of a basic block right now calls are considered hard boundaries for optimization and information cannot be propagated across them! sss fixme rather than treat all calls with a broad brush what we need is to capture different attributes about a call uses closures known call target can modify scope etc. this information is probably already present in the ast inspector
DESIGN	todo determine whether we should perhaps store non singleton class in the implementationclass
DESIGN	sss fixme correct? where does closure arg come from?
DESIGN	sss fixme should i have a reference to the ir loop that is being retried?
DESIGN	temporary hack to handle non ruby values will come up with better solution shortly
DESIGN	simplify the variables too to keep these variables in sync with what is actually used in the when clauses this is not required for correctness reasons but only for performance reasons.
DESIGN	must be called from main thread it is currently but this bothers me
DESIGN	con fixme i don t know how to make case be an expression...does that logic need to go here?
DESIGN	something wrong we don t know the cwd... todo is this behavior really desirable? mov
DESIGN	todo no java stringity
DESIGN	fixme total hack to get flash in rails marshalling unmarshalling in session ok...we need to totally change marshalling to work with overridden core classes.
DESIGN	todo this method is not present in mri!
DESIGN	fixme ideally javaobject instances should be marshallable which means that the javaobject metaclass should have an appropriate allocator. jruby 414
DESIGN	todo public only?
DESIGN	fixme this should probably do some translation from ruby priority levels to java priority levels until we have green threads
DESIGN	todo consider a better way of synchronizing
DESIGN	using ioinputstream may not be the most performance way but it s easy.
DESIGN	fixme we should not be regenerating this over and over
DESIGN	xxx this check previously used callmethod to check for equality between classes when scanning the hierarchy. however the check may be safe we should only ever have one instance bound to a given type constant. if it s found to be unsafe examine ways to avoid the call.
DESIGN	todo why are we duplicating the constants here and then in file constants below? file constants is included in io.
DESIGN	a cloned method now belongs to a new class. set it. todo make dynamicmethod immutable
DESIGN	todo these were missing so we re not handling them elsewhere?
DESIGN	fixme wtf is this? why would these use the class?
DESIGN	todo figure out how this can happen and possibly remove
DESIGN	fixme i don t like this
DESIGN	fixme these descriptions should probably be moved out to constantine project which deals with all platform dependent constants.
DESIGN	fixme this below is temporary but its much safer for cow it prevents not shared strings with begin ! 0 this allows now e.g. bytelist set not to be begin aware
DESIGN	todo what about n arg?
DESIGN	fixme i think this chunk is equivalent to mri id2name and not our public method id2name . make into method if used more than once.
DESIGN	todo cache?
DESIGN	fixme this is probably not very efficient since it loads all methods for each call
DESIGN	hack in to replace usual readline with this
DESIGN	todo this is kinda gross
DESIGN	fixme in order for thread to play well with the standard new behavior it must provide an allocator that can create empty object instances which initialize then fills with appropriate data.
DESIGN	these extra arrays are really unfortunate split some of these paths out to eliminate?
DESIGN	if not overloaded we add a method that guesses at which signature to use todo just adding first one right now...add in signature guessing logic
DESIGN	sss fixme this should never get called for constant svalues
DESIGN	. todo this version is better than the hackish previous one. windows. behavior needs to be defined though. i suppose this version. could be improved more too.. todo etc passwd is also inadequate for macosx since it does not. use etc passwd for regular user accounts.
DESIGN	fixme there s some code duplication here with rubyobject inspect
DESIGN	fixme figure out why we get null sometimes
DESIGN	hacky advance position to eat newline here....
DESIGN	need to reexamine this
DESIGN	workaround for jruby 4149
DESIGN	using iooutputstream may not be the most performance way but it s easy.
DESIGN	enebo lots of optz in 1.9 parser here
DESIGN	fixme move out of this class!
DESIGN	in fact we should probably raise an error yes?
DESIGN	todo get rid of this lax returns 0.0 strict will throw
DESIGN	bit risky if someone changes completor but useful for method calls
DESIGN	todo the rest of this...seeking to same position is unnecessary since we share a channel but some of this may be needed?
DESIGN	todo is this the right thing to do?
DESIGN	fixme this probably belongs in a different package.
DESIGN	we clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block. any previously captured instances of this block may still be around and we do not want to start overwriting those values when we create a new one. enebo once we make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable we can remove duplicate
DESIGN	todo is this correct ?
DESIGN	sss fixme do we need to check if l is same as whatever popped?
DESIGN	sss fixme where is this set up? how is this diff from classvardeclnode??
DESIGN	fixme do we need the check or does main.java not call this...they should consolidate
DESIGN	fixme this table will get moved into posix library so we can get all actual supported signals. this is a quick fix to support basic signals until that happens.
DESIGN	fixme this worries me a bit since it could allocate a lot with a large newlength
DESIGN	todo this filtering is kind of gross...it would be nice to get some parser help here
DESIGN	this is gross but java api s aren t iso 8601 compliant at all
DESIGN	fixme get rid of laziness and handle restricted access elsewhere
DESIGN	todo for now we use a faithful reimplementation of mri s algorithm but should use utf8encoding facilities from joni once it starts prefroming utf 8 content validation.
DESIGN	fixme determine if a real allocator is needed here. do people want to extend javaclass? do we want them to do that? can you class.new javaclass ? should you be able to? todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we don t intend for people to monkey with this type and it can t be marshalled. confirm. jruby 415
DESIGN	grrr arghh want to subclass sun.misc.floatingdecimal but can t so we must do all this the next 70 lines of code which has already been done by floatingdecimal.
DESIGN	fixme do we really want declared methods? includes private protected and does not include superclass methods. also the getdeclared calls may throw securityexception if we re running under a restrictive security policy.
DESIGN	small hack to save a cast later on
DESIGN	there s not a compelling reason to keep javaclass instances in a weak map any proxies created are were kept in a non weak map so in most cases they will stick around anyway and some good reasons not to javaclass creation is expensive for one many lookups are performed when passing parameters to from methods etc. . todo faster custom concurrent map
DESIGN	todo check for java reserved names and raise exception if encountered
DESIGN	fixme jruby 3188 ends up with condition returning null...quick fix until i can dig into it
DESIGN	workaround for a bug in sun s jdk 1.5.x see http bugs.sun.com bugdatabase view bug.do?bug id 6303753
DESIGN	fixme weakref.rb also does caller 2 here for the backtrace
DESIGN	fixme remove this from grammars.
DESIGN	todo it s perhaps just a coincidence that all the channels for which we should raise are instanceof selectablechannel since stdio is not...so this bothers me slightly. con
DESIGN	fixme not sure what the semantics of transfer are cfiber.definefastmethod transfer cb.getfastoptmethod transfer
DESIGN	fixme this is pretty gross we should have a cleaner initialization that doesn t depend on package visible fields and ideally is atomic probably using an immutable structure we replace all at once. lazy null when no groups defined
DESIGN	this is a dummy scope we should find a way to make that more explicit
DESIGN	fixme resolve what the hell is going on
DESIGN	fixme maybe not best place but move it to a good home
DESIGN	todo not allocatable allocator may be ok here but it s unclear how structs work with marshalling. confirm behavior and ensure we re doing this correctly. jruby 415
DESIGN	we always prepend an org.jruby.proxy package to the beginning because java and javax packages are protected and signed jars prevent us generating new classes with those package names. see jruby 2439.
DESIGN	todo we should be able to optimize this quite a bit post 1.0. javaclass already has all the methods organized by method name the next version supporting protected methods fields will have them organized even further. so collectmethods here can just lookup the overridden methods in the javaclass map should be much faster.
DESIGN	todo make more efficient by not creating irubyarray
DESIGN	rb mod remove cvar. . fixme any good reason to have two identical methods? same as remove class variable .
DESIGN	from dup setup rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here ...unlikely..
DESIGN	if we don t have opt args start after args they will be assigned later this is for crap like def foo a b true 1 which numbers b before a fixme only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileroot using 0 to indicate signature.
DESIGN	if it s a single arg when but contains an array we know it s a real literal array fixme this is a gross way to figure it out parser help similar to yield argument passing expandarguments would be better
DESIGN	todo only setaccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non public interface. aka java.util.zip.zipconstants being implemented by many classes
DESIGN	not intended to be called directly by users private old todo from ruby code this should be implemented in javaclass.java where we can check for reserved ruby names conflicting methods etc.
DESIGN	fixme don t allow multiple threads to do this at once
DESIGN	todo bleeding runtime into parser. arity may be should be in parser to keep bleeding oneway
DESIGN	rb ary push m. fixme whis is this named push m ?.
DESIGN	todo this probably isn t the best hack but it works until we can have different root frame setup for 1.9 easily.
DESIGN	todo at least parsersupport.attrset passes argsnode as null. implicitnil is wrong magic for setupargs since it will irubyobject nil . so we need to figure out a nice fast null pattern for setupargs. assert argsnode ! null receivernode is not null
DESIGN	hack in order to have stdout err act like ttys and flush always we set anything assigned to stdout stderr to sync
DESIGN	todo people extending gzipwriter reader will break. find better way here.
DESIGN	fixme set up a call configuration for this
DESIGN	. process streams get channel.newchannel ed into filechannel but are not actually. seekable. so instead of just the isseekable check doing instanceof filechannel . we must also add this boolean to check which we set to false when it s known. that the incoming channel is from a process.. . fixme this is gross and it s nio s fault for not providing a nice way to. tell if a channel is really seekable..
DESIGN	again shouldn t happen. todo might want to throw exception instead.
DESIGN	fixme can get optimized for ieqlnode
DESIGN	todo rounding mode should not be hard coded. see mode.
DESIGN	fixme moved this here to get what s obviously a utility method out of irubyobject. perhaps security methods should find their own centralized home at some point.
DESIGN	fixme if nativeexception is expected to be used from ruby code it should provide a real allocator to be used. otherwise class.new will fail as will marshalling. jruby 415
DESIGN	fixme this should go somewhere more generic maybe idutil
DESIGN	sss fixme move this code to some utils area .. or probably there is already a method for this in some jruby utils class holy cow! just to append two darned arrays!
DESIGN	todo set our metaclass to target s class i.e. scary!
DESIGN	add new with full signature so it s guaranteed to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature
DESIGN	context is null wipe out the softreference this could be done with a reference queue
DESIGN	todo remove
DESIGN	todo this is actually now returning the scope of whoever called method to proc which is obviously wrong but there s no scope to provide for many methods. it fixes jruby 2237 but needs a better solution.
DESIGN	. . author headius. fixme convert to enum ?.
DESIGN	the following three methods must be defined fast since they expect to modify the current frame i.e. they expect no frame will be allocated for them . jruby 1185.
DESIGN	sss fixme can this return anything other than nil?
DESIGN	xxx const lookup can trigger const missing is that enough to warrant it always being executed?
DESIGN	todo should frozen error have its own distinct class? if not should more share?
DESIGN	todo only used by interface implementation eliminate it
DESIGN	fixme null check is removable once we figure out how to assign to unset named block args
DESIGN	for jruby 2759 when met choose cet timezone to work around joda
DESIGN	fixme this is gross. don t do this.
DESIGN	fixme i think we need these pushed somewhere?
DESIGN	sss fixme deprecated! going forward all instructions should come from the cfg
DESIGN	todo should probably apply the null object pattern for a non allowed class rather than null
DESIGN	todo should next and return also catch here?
DESIGN	yow...this is still ugly
DESIGN	add method with full signature so it s guaranteed to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature
DESIGN	. fixme this version is faster than the previous but both suffer from a. crucial flaw it is impossible to create an objectspace with an iterator. that doesn t either a. hold on to objects that might otherwise be collected. or b. have no way to guarantee that a call to hasnext will be correct or. that a subsequent call to next will produce an object. for our purposes . for now this may be acceptable..
DESIGN	fixme clearing read buffer here...is this appropriate?
DESIGN	todo specifying soft refs may want to compare memory consumption behavior with weak refs specify weak in place of soft below
DESIGN	fixme lose syntactical elements here and others like this
DESIGN	enebo totally weird naming in mri is not allocated and is a local var name
DESIGN	fixme this doesn t actually support anything but string
DESIGN	up to ten stuff into tmp locals load in reverse order and assign fixme there s probably a slightly smarter way but is it important?
DESIGN	xxx do something?
DESIGN	todo only setaccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non public interface. aka java.util.zip.zipconstants being implemented by many classes todo not sure we need this at all since we only expose public fields. field.setaccessible true
DESIGN	fixme we want to eliminate these type casts when possible
DESIGN	todo decompose getjavapackagemodule so we don t parse fullname
DESIGN	hack force clinit to be created
DESIGN	fixme if true array is common enough we should pre allocate and stick somewhere
DESIGN	todo this is almost rubymodule instance methods on the metaclass. perhaps refactor.
DESIGN	fixme added this because marshal spec seemed to reconstitute objects without calling datawrapstruct this resulted in object being null after unmarshalling...
DESIGN	todo ary sort check should be done here
DESIGN	exit monitor before making call fixme this not being in a finally is a little worrisome
DESIGN	self args 0 sss fixme verify that this is correct
DESIGN	this is for jruby 2988 since after a suspend the terminal seems to need to be reinitialized. since we can t easily detect suspension initialize after every readline. probably not fast but this is for interactive terminals anyway...so who cares?
DESIGN	todo do above but not below for additional newline nodes
DESIGN	sss fixme receiver this is the class meta object basically? operand receiver build defsnode.getreceivernode s
DESIGN	fixme this whole thing could probably be implemented as a module and mixed into appropriate classes especially if it uses either ioinput outputstream or is smart about the kind of io like object it s being used against.
DESIGN	fixme bit of a kludge here non interface classes assigned to both class and module fields . simplifies proxy extender code will go away when ji is overhauled and proxy extenders are deprecated .
DESIGN	fixme what should these really be? numeric? assert x instanceof rubycomplex y instanceof rubycomplex
DESIGN	we re depending on the side effect of the load which loads the class but does not turn it into a script i don t like it but until we restructure the code a bit more we ll need to quietly let it by here.
DESIGN	fixme we should also support orgs that use capitalized package names including embarrassingly the one i work for but this should be enabled by a system property as the expected default behavior for an upper case value should be and is to treat it as a class name and raise an exception if it s not found
DESIGN	index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end?
DESIGN	fixme this is temporary since the variable compilers assume we want args already on stack for assignment. we just pop and continue with 1.9 args logic.
DESIGN	todo eliminate?
DESIGN	todo handle writing into original buffer better
DESIGN	this is a fairly specific hack for empty string but it does the job
DESIGN	xxx this constructor is a hack to implement the end syntax. converting a reader back into an inputstream doesn t generally work.
DESIGN	method has more than 500 lines we ll need to split it and therefore need to use a heap based scope
DESIGN	the implementations of these are all bonus see todo above i was going to throw an error from these but it appears to be the wrong place to do it.
DESIGN	entry exists proxy doesn t match. replace. this could happen if old proxy was gc ed todo raise exception if stored proxy is non null? not gc ed
DESIGN	todo better algorithm to set precision needed
DESIGN	. sss fixme used anywhere? i don t see calls to this anywhere. public operand builddasgnassignment node node ir scope s . dasgnnode dasgnnode dasgnnode node . s.getvariablecompiler .assignlocalvariable dasgnnode.getindex dasgnnode.getdepth . .
DESIGN	todo make this more intelligible value
DESIGN	todo split this into two sub classes so that name and constnode can be specified seperately.
DESIGN	not sure how well this works but it works much better than just currenttimemillis by itself.
DESIGN	fixme this is copied code from rubyarray. both re struct and array should share one impl this is also hacky since i construct ruby objects to access ruby arrays through aref instead of something lower.
DESIGN	fixme no i don t like it.
DESIGN	arguments compilers always create irubyobject but we want to use rubyarray.concat here fixme as a result this is not efficient since it creates and then later unwraps an array
DESIGN	fixme set up a callconfiguration for this
DESIGN	todo reads writes from frame todo information on scoping todo visibility?
DESIGN	fixme somehow i d feel better if this could get the appropriate var index from the argumentnode
DESIGN	fixme this is almost entirely duplicated from main.java
DESIGN	we might need to perform a dst correction
DESIGN	create block for this iter node fixme we shouldn t use the current scope if it s not actually from the same hierarchy of static scopes
DESIGN	fixme how much more obtuse can this be? heredoc already parsed this and saved string...do not parse..just return
DESIGN	this needs to be split since conditional calling inherited doesn t fit standard ruby semantics
DESIGN	xxx again screwy evaling under previous frame s scope
DESIGN	sss fixme maybe this is not really a concern after all ... nesting level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scopes in the current file this is not to be confused with semantic nesting of scopes across files. consider this code in a file f class m1 m2 m3 c ... end so c is at lexical nesting level of 1 the file script is at 0 in the file f semantically it is at level 3 m1 m2 m3 are at 0 1 2 . this is primarily used to ensure that variable names don t clash! i.e. definition of v 1 in a closure shouldn t override the use of v 1 from the parent scope! private int lexicalnestinglevel
DESIGN	actual type does not exactly match method return type re get converter fixme when the only autoconversions are primitives this won t be needed
DESIGN	fixme we should probably still be dyncalling write here
DESIGN	don t bother to check if final method it won t be there not generated can t be!
DESIGN	todo generalize this type checking code into irubyobject helper.
DESIGN	fixme needs to be rethought
DESIGN	ruby constants for strings should this be moved somewhere else?
DESIGN	let s only generate methods for those the user may actually intend to override. that includes any defined in the current class and any ancestors that are also javaproxyclasses but none from any other ancestor classes . methods defined in mixins will be considered intentionally overridden except those from kernel java and javaproxymethods as well as enumerable. todo may want to exclude other common mixins?
DESIGN	fixme i don t like the null checks here
DESIGN	invoke callmethodmissing method directly todo this could be further optimized since some dsls hit method missing pretty hard...
DESIGN	todo confirm expected args are irubyobject or similar
DESIGN	todo this is really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone require s something. we should try to make loadpath a special array object.
DESIGN	if we get here we found a matching method use it todo choose narrowest method by continuing to search
DESIGN	rb obj id. . return the internal id of an object.. . fixme should this be renamed to match its ruby name?.
DESIGN	fixme why was this using a fullfunctioncallbackmethod before that did callsuper?
DESIGN	. fixme this does not have exact same semantics as rubyarray.join but they. probably could be consolidated perhaps as join args sep dochomp ..
DESIGN	lame generics issues making segment class static and manually inserting cache reference to work around various problems generically referencing methods vars across classes.
DESIGN	fixme this determine module is in a strange location and should somehow be in block
DESIGN	todo? i think this ends up propagating from normal java exceptions sys fail openfile.getpath
DESIGN	this seems unlikely to happen unless it s a totally bogus fileno ...so do we even need to bother trying to create one?
DESIGN	todo turn off the negative? will return 0.0 in lax mode
DESIGN	todo list.sublist from to .clear is supposed to clear the sublist from the list. how can we support this operation?
DESIGN	sss fixme what is the difference between classvarasgnnode classvardeclnode
DESIGN	see note below re 2 field kludge
DESIGN	we re not setting the provider or anything but it seems that bouncycastle does some internal things in its provider s constructor which require it to be executed in a secure context. ideally this hack should be removed. see jruby 3919 and this bc bug http www.bouncycastle.org jira browse bja 227
DESIGN	this is a rather ugly hack but similar to mri. see hash.c ruby setenv and similar in mri we search all keys for a case insensitive match and use that
DESIGN	todo wrong get interfaces from class
DESIGN	todo make callcoerced work in block context...then fix downto step and upto.
DESIGN	fixme the code below is a copy of rubyio.puts and we should avoid copy paste.
DESIGN	install invokedynamic bootstrapper todo need to abstract this setup behind another compiler interface
DESIGN	fixme inefficient constructing a bignum just for dumping?
DESIGN	todo ruby does not seem to care about invalid numeric mode values i am not sure if ruby overflows here also...
DESIGN	fixme obvious issue that not all platforms can display all attributes. ugly hacks. using generic posix library makes pushing inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful.
DESIGN	rb copy generic ivar from dup setup here ...unlikely..
DESIGN	fixme this really ought to be in clinit but it doesn t matter much
DESIGN	todo callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost constants are rarely assigned
DESIGN	using iochannel may not be the most performant way but it s easy.
DESIGN	todo this should entry into error handling somewhere
DESIGN	todo make this do specific arity calling
DESIGN	fixme legal here? may want unsupportedoperationexception
DESIGN	fixme this is an ugly hack to resolve jruby 1381 i m not proud of it
DESIGN	for visibility checking without requiring frame self todo don t bother passing when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately
DESIGN	sss fixme what happens to the add class in this case??
DESIGN	sss fixme is this correct?
DESIGN	fixme big fat hack here because scope names are expected to be interned strings by the parser
DESIGN	ignore...bean doesn t get registered todo why does that bother me?
DESIGN	sss fixme are we guaranteed that we splats dont head to multiple assignment nodes! i.e. a b ?
DESIGN	todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here. confirm. jruby 415
DESIGN	todo catch exception if constant is already set by other thread
DESIGN	todo this version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it doesn t perhaps no difference for us?
DESIGN	todo implement tty? and isatty. we have no real capability to determine this from java but if we could set tty status then we could invoke jruby differently to allow stdin to return true on this. this would allow things like cgi.rb to work properly.
DESIGN	fixme we should be getting this from the runtime rather than assume none? return runtime.getencodingservice .getencoding runtime.getdefaultexternalencoding
DESIGN	object to a is obsolete. we match ruby s hack until to a goes away. then we can remove this hack too.
DESIGN	todo this isn t an exact port of mri s pipe behavior so revisit
DESIGN	todo protected methods. this is going to require a rework of some of the mechanism.
DESIGN	todo factor this chunk as in mri yarv getaster
DESIGN	fixme what should this really be? assert x instanceof rubycomplex
DESIGN	fixme this isn t right for within ensured rescued code
DESIGN	sss fixme token can be final for a method implying that the token is only for this particular implementation of the method but if the mehod is modified we create a new method object which in turn gets a new token. what makes sense?? intuitively it seems the first one ... but let us see ... current code version token for this method can change during execution as methods get redefined!
DESIGN	set up a field for the cacheentry todo make this an array so it s not as much class metadata similar to abstractscript stuff
DESIGN	todo it would be nice to throw a better error for this
DESIGN	todo newtypeerror does not offer enough for ruby error string...
DESIGN	sss fixme i added this in. is this correct?
DESIGN	upper case package name todo top level upper case package was supported in the previous ruby based implementation so leaving as is. see note at getproxyorpackageunderpackage re future approach below the top level.
DESIGN	todo this is also defined in the metaclass too...consolidate somewhere.
DESIGN	fixme constdecl could be two seperate classes or done differently since constnode and name never exist at the same time.
DESIGN	fixme finalizer should be dupped here
DESIGN	todo not allocatable allocator is probably ok here since we don t intend for people to monkey with this type and it can t be marshalled. confirm. jruby 415
DESIGN	todo number formatting here mri uses .10g 1.4 api is a must?
DESIGN	todo need to get this back into the method signature...now is too late...
DESIGN	super calls from proxies must use reflected method fixme possible to make handles do the superclass call?
DESIGN	optional args so we have irubyobject todo confirm
DESIGN	todo better error handling
DESIGN	fixme not very efficient
DESIGN	sss fixme should this be operand or compoundstring? can it happen that symbols are built out of other than compound strings? or can it happen during optimizations that this becomes a generic operand?
DESIGN	fixme we should really not be creating the dynamic scope for the root of the ast before parsing. this makes us end up needing to readjust this dynamic scope coming out of parse and for local static scopes it will always happen because of and . fixme because we end up adjusting this after the fact we can t use any of the specific size scopes.
DESIGN	todo wire into new exception handling mechanism
DESIGN	todo not sure that we should skip calling join altogether. thread.join has some implications for java memory model etc.
DESIGN	hack to get right style for input
DESIGN	if variables were added then we may need to grow the dynamic scope to match the static one. fixme make this so we only need to check this for blockscope ! null. we cannot currently since we create the dynamicscope for a localstaticscope before parse begins. refactoring should make this fixable.
DESIGN	sss fixme this method at least in the context of multiple assignment is a little weird. it calls regular to ary on the object. but if it encounters a method missing the value is inserted into an 1 element array! try a b c 1 first then define fixnum.to ary method and try it again. ex http gist.github.com 163551
DESIGN	fixme potentially could just use bytelist here?
DESIGN	fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a bare runtime without a proper scope
DESIGN	fixme consider fixing node assign itself rather than single case
DESIGN	this is perhaps innefficient timewise? optimal spacewise
DESIGN	end hack
DESIGN	ignore job was cancelled fixme is this ok?
DESIGN	regular division with some default precision todo proper algorithm to set the precision
DESIGN	todo exec should replace the current process. this could be possible with jna.
DESIGN	sometimes the value can be retrieved at compile time . if we succeed nothing like it! we might not .. for the following reasons 1. the constant is missing 2. the reference is a forward reference 3. the constant s value is only known at run time on first access but this is runtime isn t it?? 4. our compiler isn t able to right away infer that this is a constant. sss fixme 1. the operand can be a literal array range or hash hence operand because array range and hash derive from operand and not constant ... is there a way to fix this impedance mismatch? 2. it should be possible to handle the forward reference case by creating a new forwardreference operand and then inform the scope of the forward reference which the scope can fix up when the reference gets defined. at code gen time if the reference is unresolved when a value is retrieved for the forward ref and we get a null we can throw a constmissing exception! not sure!
DESIGN	fixme not allocatable allocator is probably not right here since we might eventually want javaarray to be marshallable. jruby 414
DESIGN	workaround for jruby 2326 mri does not enter this production for some reason
DESIGN	if body is a rescue node inspect its pieces separately to avoid it disabling all optz todo this is gross.
DESIGN	todo this is probably bad...
DESIGN	fixme do we really want declared methods? includes private protected and does not include superclass methods
DESIGN	fixme shouldn t need java ovrd methods just query locally defined methods.
DOCUMENTATION	fixme document difference between warn and warning or rename one better
DOCUMENTATION	fixme only f setfl and f getfl is current supported fixme only nonblock flag is supported fixme f setfl and f setfd are treated as the same thing here. for the case of dup fd we should actually have f setfl only affect one it is unclear how well we do but this todo is here to at least document that we might need to do more work here. mostly setfl is for mode changes which should persist across fork boundaries. since jvm has no fork this is not a problem for us.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo call config with scope but no frame
IMPLEMENTATION	todo clone setup here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo non strict option
IMPLEMENTATION	todo adjust length so it won t fall in the middle of a multi byte character. mri s sprintf.c uses tables in a modified version of regex.c which assume some particular encoding for a given installation application. see regex.c re mbcinit in ruby 1.8.5 p12 this is only an issue if the user specifies a precision that causes the string to be truncated. the same issue would arise taking a substring of a bytelist backed rubystring.
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme r logic needed
IMPLEMENTATION	todo note lack of command.com support for win 9x...
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme create attrreadermethod attrwritermethod for faster attr access
IMPLEMENTATION	todo 3 times calculate the same value below
IMPLEMENTATION	todo opt for 2 and 3 ?
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme optimize for cases where we have no false branch
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme after jump is not in here. will if ever be? label afterjmp new label
IMPLEMENTATION	todo missing additional logic for dealing with conflicting protected fields.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo deal with unc names
IMPLEMENTATION	todo rescan code range ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo pass this in?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo warn tried to create proc object without a block
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make threadsafe
IMPLEMENTATION	todo port exact behavior from mri and move most locking logic into channeldescriptor todo for all lock nb cases return false if they would block
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do something here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo pipe handler to be reopened with path and w mode
IMPLEMENTATION	todo other reserved names?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo better detection when path is absolute or not. if the path isn t absolute then prepend the current working directory to the path.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo store begin and end information into this node
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby locks the string here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo put these nil guards into tree bigger than i want to do right now
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme should we make this work with platform s locale or continue hardcoding us?
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme make bodynode non null in parser
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme pass block down?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add trace call?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo build arg list based on number of args optionals etc
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check for ascii string
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme traverse up the scope hierarchy to find the constant as long as the parent is a static scope
IMPLEMENTATION	xxx shouldn t check if valid option variable
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme should i be returning the operand constructed here?
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme arg concat missing for opt call args
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add ir instructions for checking method arity! s.getvariablecompiler .checkmethodarity required opt rest
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add safety check for taintedness
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme ruby 1.9 post args code needs to come here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make sure all appropriate open flags are added to this check.
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme somewhere here we need to record information the type of this operand as string
IMPLEMENTATION	xxx check if it s appropriate type?
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme translate this call below! s.unwrappassedblock
IMPLEMENTATION	sublist.clear sublist is supposed to share same backing store as list...todo in rubyarray. asserttrue list.size 1
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme we need to build debug information tracking into the ir in some fashion so these methods below would have to have equivalents in ir scope implementations.
IMPLEMENTATION	fix replace type ... with isinstanceof ...
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme incomplete!
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme pick one of bytelist or string or add internal conversion methods to convert to the default representation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if too many open files gc and try again
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme cannot optimize this without assuming that range.to ary method has not redefined. so for now return null!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this and recacherespondsto needed to be synchronized for jruby 3466 but this degraded performance nearly 2x. it s still faster than mri but a reanalysis of this code may show a faster way to ensure we re caching safely.
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme to be done
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme arg concat logic missing for opt call args
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme need to detect magic comment in 1.9 here for encoding
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement won t do this now
IMPLEMENTATION	todo validate port as numeric
IMPLEMENTATION	todo same zero length checks as file above
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this code should really check if a ruby equals method is implemented or not.
IMPLEMENTATION	if not already defined we add a new that guesses at which signature to use todo just adding first one right now...add in signature guessing logic
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme make thread pool threads daemons if necessary
IMPLEMENTATION	todo deal with varargs
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme we may be intern ing more than once.
IMPLEMENTATION	filter out any java primitive names todo should check against all java reserved names here not just primitives
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we can probably release our references to the constantfields array and static instance callback hashes at this point.
IMPLEMENTATION	do not clone cached methods fixme mri copies all methods here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check safe taint on incoming string
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mri is just a when node. we need this extra logic for ide consumers null in casenode statement should be implicit nil
IMPLEMENTATION	todo formalize conversion mechanisms between java and ruby
IMPLEMENTATION	todo turn off readable? am i reading this right? this only seems to be used while duping below since modes gets reset to actual modes afterward fptr mode m fmode readable ? fmode readable fmode writable
IMPLEMENTATION	todo someday enable.
IMPLEMENTATION	bunch of methods still not implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make it cross runtime safe by cow or eager copy
IMPLEMENTATION	todo don t calculate the same value 3 times
IMPLEMENTATION	todo notify threads waiting on descriptors io? probably not...
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme when we get jna3 we need to properly write this to errno.
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme add text mode to mode flags
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby unlocks the string here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo call ruby method
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme don t use rubyio for this
IMPLEMENTATION	todo something about pipe buffer length here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mri also can hadle bignum here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby truncates string to specific size here but our bytelist should handle this already?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle errors in buffered write by retrying until finished or file is closed
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme missing arity check
IMPLEMENTATION	todo must override in rubymodule to pick up constants
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check the return value here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this isn t handling multibyte yet
IMPLEMENTATION	todo safestringvalue here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo no need to calculate every time.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this should be something else like a tchar
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme this needs to happen for lambdas args.checkargcount runtime parameters.length
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby re checks that the buffer string hasn t been modified
TEST	?r boolean true if file is readable by the real uid gid of the caller fixme need to implement an readable real p in filetest
TEST	?w boolean true if file1 exists and is writable by the real uid gid fixme need to implement an writable real p in filetest
TEST	todo add test methods here. the name must begin with test . for example
TEST	if the method is extending something then we have to test if the handler is initialized...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the reason why we need the stream is to be able to invoke available on it. stdin in java is non interruptible non selectable and attempt to read on such stream might lead to thread being blocked without any way to unblock it. that s where available comes it so at least we could check whether anything is available to be read without blocking.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a gotcha
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we provide default impls of a number of signatures. for each arity we first generate a non block version of the method which just adds null block and re calls allowing e.g. compiled code which always can potentially take a block to only generate the block receiving signature and still avoid arg boxing. we then provide default implementations of each block accepting method that in turn call the irubyobject block version of call. this then finally falls back on the minimum implementation requirement for dynamic method handles.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	line 362
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include all interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all public constructors note getconstructors only returns public ones
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all instance and static methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ruby name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note the five match methods are arity split to avoid the cost of boxing arguments when there s already a cached match. do not condense them into a single method.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only include static methods if specified
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only public static fields that are valid constants
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add a few type specific special methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all static variables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	long first because it s what fixnum claims to be
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we hold a java object we need a java class accessor
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	todo varargs?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double first because it s what float claims to be
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end of scoping for closure s vars
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	dummy bodies for default impls
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	walk all superclasses aggregating interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	too much array creation!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize cache of parameter types to method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	look through all mappings to find a match entry for this field
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hit a non java proxy class included modules can be a cause of this...skip
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we could not find all of them print out first one we could print them all?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	next we define a few private methods that we ll use to manipulate the java object contained within this ruby object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize this if it hasn t been
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invoke static file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize these if they haven t been
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the mirror class and parent classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setup new etc unless this is a concretejavaproxy subclass
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not allowed for original non generated java classes note not allowing for any previously created class right now this restriction might be loosened later for generated classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	exact arg list file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	list of interfaces we implement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we capture the original new and make it private
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	declare the field
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct new array proxy arrayjavaproxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	boxed arg list file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get map of all fields we want to define.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we ve already done the above priming logic just add another interface to the list of intentions unless we re past the point of no return or already intend to implement the given interface
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jcreate instantiates the proxy object which implements all interfaces and which is wrapped and implemented by this object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	implement all forces implementation of all interfaces we intend for this class to implement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we add an implement and implement all methods to the class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not allowed for existing java interface modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	weakly reserved names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	array creation should use this variant
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setup constants for public inner classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jruby 3014 make file dynamically determined at load time but we provide a reasonable default here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	parent.setconstant name proxyclass where the name should come from ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	keep this variant for kind of? testing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	already set up append features just add the interface if we haven t already
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	array of interface type creation identity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	?l boolean true if file1 exists and is a symbolic link
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this try catch is to allow failing over to the commands logic when running from within a jruby complete jar file which has jruby.home a jar file url that does not resolve correctly with jrubyfile.create.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	including interface module so old style interface subclasses will respond correctly to kind of? etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add reference to interface module
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	figure end char. 0 is special to indicate begin end and that no nesting?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy is complete return it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct static scope list of names
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	same as argument types but matches name in java.lang.reflect.constructor method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy module for interfaces
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	called only by initializing thread no synchronization required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	proxy class for concrete classes. also used for concrete interfaces which is why we have two fields
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there s no constructor we must prevent construction
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	something?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow proxy to be read without synchronization. if proxy is under construction only the building thread can see it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	modified only by addmethod no synchronization required
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now add all aliases for the static methods fields as appropriate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	line 1329
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store previous exception for restoration if we rescue something
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing it s a non impl method
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	line 1377
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	additionally add ? postfixed aliases to any boolean methods and properties.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add main impl used for detached or command line execution of this script with a new runtime root method of a script is always in stub0 method0
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add property name aliases
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	getfoo foo getfoo int foo int
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	setfoo foo foo foo
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no seconds just yield
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	1.9 support for encodings
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	many cases are ok to convert to float if not one of these error
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	getfoobar foobar? foo bar?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	synthetic methods always have zero arg parameters
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	break jump
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	undefinedmethod should be immutable
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we force argparamcount to 1 since we always know we ll have args
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now iterate over all installers and make sure they also have appropriate aliases
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	skip catch block
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	main body
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to collect all methods though we ll only install the ones that are named in this class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore bad constant named inner classes pending jruby 697
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double check the cache now that we re synchronized
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can t be converted any more return it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	java.getproxyclass deals with sync issues so we won t duplicate the logic here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	eq 0 i.e. false pop the extra result and replace with the send part of the and
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	old quasi deprecated interface class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	is something? contains thing?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isfoo foo isfoo foo
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datagram set accordingly again af inet
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we all all superclasses but avoid adding superclass methods with same name signature as subclass methods see jruby 3130
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	eq 0 i.e. false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore we won t use invokedynamic
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	restrictive security policy no matter we only want public classes anyway
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	call istrue on the result
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see note above re return type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	very restrictive policy disallows member.public we d never actually get this far in that case
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore if it s not a global var
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	irubyobject family args 2
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	dup it since we need to return appropriately if it s false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one dimensional array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it s an array of arrays recurse with the component type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	n dimensional array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use specific arity for as much as possible
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clear body or next result after each successful loop
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	load args 0 which will be the irubyobject representing block args
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if not a property but is boolean add ? postfixed aliases.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	done with closure compilation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	must be back on first line on rewind.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invoke file with threadcontext self args null and block null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	brute force construction inline
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for object default to natural wrapper type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	af inet
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not true eval value and assign
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	rubymodule rubymodule string
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hmmmm
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	12!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	rubyobject is already of the required jruby class or subclass
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	thread context
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we ve found a java type to which we ve coerced the ruby value wrap it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it s not one of the types we convert so just pass it out as is without wrapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	can t set tc classloader
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create dir if necessary
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	255.255.255.255
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we append an index to ensure two identical method names will not conflict
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the class with the appropriate class name and source file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	line number
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	line 323
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for specific index cases clean up non expression values
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include interface modules into the proxy class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	java.lang.object is added at root of java proxy classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate block bodies initialization code
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this also handles unsigned int negative signed int conversion
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	include any interfaces we extend
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now attach java related extras to core classes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the template for interface modules
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no variable initialization because we re reusing parent s scope flat
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate variable readers initialization code
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	shouldn t happen but if a superclass is specified it s not ours
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add all name to class mappings
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add some base java classes everyone will need

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this point is only reached if there was an exception handler installed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate symbols initialization code
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	interfacejavaproxy.createinterfacejavaproxy context
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save package module as ivar in parent and add method to parent so we don t have to come back here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is where we ll get connected when classes are opened using package module syntax.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if that succeeds the others should as well
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for seek cur need to adjust for buffered data

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we hit eof or reached limit then we re done
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	re register
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	fill local vars with nil to avoid checking every access.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in 1.8 mode this will be a rubyarray containing the arguments in 1.9 mode this will be an irubyobject
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	catch logic for flow control next break
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	build descriptor string

DEFECT	bug 1995728 ms sql is inconsistent with regard to setting the current catalog. if you have a database with periods or spaces then in some cases you must surround the catalog with quotes. for example if you have a catalog named db with spaces you must execute the following sql use db with spaces however the same is not always true for the jdbc api method connection.setcatalog. for some old versions of microsoft drivers you must quote the catalog as well. but for newer versions of the driver you must not quote the catalog. so here we attempt to use the unquoted version first then if that fails we will try quoting it.

DESIGN	when i tried using a length for longvarbinary that is the max length of the source records i get the following exception exception condition 239. data exception string data right truncation. i tried bit varying 32767 with data that had max length of 16384. so it s back to maximum length hard coded for now. registercolumntype types.longvarbinary 2147000000 bit varying l
DESIGN	. todo this should not be public. check all usages of it. and put appropriate methods in an api object..
DESIGN	jason do we need these?
DESIGN	jason do we need this? getsqlpanel .selected
DESIGN	todo rename to iobjecttreenodeexpander
DESIGN	always add plugins there is not a good way to compare plugin zips and their extracted contents at the moment. todo determine the best way to derive the filesize and checksum of the plugin zip that was last extracted. should we keep it around? how about using the current release.xml file ? come to think of it perhaps we shouldn t be computing the checksum of any existing files why don t we just get it from the current release.xml file?
DESIGN	todo verify this
DESIGN	multiple rows not good
DESIGN	?? extract this out into a class like cascadeinternalframepositioner.
DESIGN	cast is not so nice but framework doesn t meet new requirements.
DESIGN	total hack! type other 1111 can be other types as well?
DESIGN	jason should be part of status bar?
DESIGN	??getridofthis
DESIGN	don t call super. packing this frame causes problems.
DESIGN	note. some dbmss such as oracle do not allow select rowid from table you cannot have any column name in the columns clause if you have in there. aliasing the table name seems to be the best way to get around the problem.
DESIGN	we are displaying a new dataset so if there was a cell editor in operation tell it to cancel. ???? how does this impact popup display?
DESIGN	kludge we want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations. ideally we would get that info inside the resultsetdataset class during the creation of the columndefinition objects by using various functions in resultsetmetadata such as isnullable idx . unfortunately in at least some dbmss e.g. postgres hsdb the results of those calls are not the same and are less accurate than the sqlmetadata.getcolumns call used in columnstab to get the column info. even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same with the resultsetmetadata listing things not provided by getcolumns. most of the data provided by the resultsetmetadata calls is correct. however the nullable not nullable property is not set correctly in at least two dbmss while it is correct for those dbmss in the getcolumns info. therefore we collect the collumn nullability information from getcolumns and pass that info to the resultset to override what it got from the resultsetmetadata.
DESIGN	. the utility class that reads and writes release info from to the release.xml file todo spring inject. when this class is a spring bean.
DESIGN	todo this won t work when the column has values with quotes in them. use preparedstatements instead. hmmm... instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a uses the sequence for the pkid b selects distinct values that would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem
DESIGN	need to somehow call sqlresultexecuterpanel.rerunselectedresulttab true something like sqlresultexecuterpanel panel getpanel panel.rerunselectedresulttab true however that doesn t apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table. there needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders. for now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually re run the query reload the table data and re export.
DESIGN	todo rename this to gettabletype.
DESIGN	todo bizarre that i couldn t find a valid sql to drop an index.
DESIGN	todo ? dialog handling on cancelled ?
DESIGN	this refactoring depends on the following api methods getcreatetablesql
DESIGN	todo probably want to allow the user to set these sequence properties ?? sequence settings.
DESIGN	we set expected and checksum to 1 here since we don t have that information for release.xml file todo can httpclient be used to get the byte size of release.xml so we can perform this check?
DESIGN	here i don t completely understand how these types are to be used in all databases and i haven t yet had time to implement support in the dialects for them. so this exclude list will keep these less commonly used types from failing the test. also since not all of these types appear in java5 and we currently support compiling the code base with it i use the integer values for new types that were introduces in java6 rather than the type constant name.
DESIGN	. todo delete this class unused.
DESIGN	. todo find out why. kludge for some reason i am not able to get the sheet to. size correctly. it always displays with a size that causes. the sub panels to have their scrollbars showing. add a bit. of an increase in the size of the panel so the scrollbars. are not displayed..
DESIGN	copied from java doc matcher.replaceall note that backslashes and dollar signs in the replacement string may cause the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string. dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string.
DESIGN	todo subclass these hibernate dialects to provide the canpasteto api method in hibernatedialect interface. private static final db2390dialect db2390dialect new db2390dialect
DESIGN	this is weird if i don t set this the column header doesn t line up with the column contents.
DESIGN	??? for now use the same renderer as everyone else. ?? ?? in future change this to use a new instance of renderer ?? for this data type.
DESIGN	todo delete me
DESIGN	for pointbase if type maps to pointbase blob and the size isn t valid pb requires size for blobs then set it to something reasonably large like 16mb. 1 is the default size if no size is specified. that s practically useless
DESIGN	should the data be first cloned so that the sorting doesn t take place on the array that is used in getvalue todo this is a must if sorting is done in a thread! ??
DESIGN	. todo when 1.4 is the earliest version supported add the following line . setsurrendersfocusonkeystroke true . this should help handle some problems with navigation using tab return. to move through cells..
DESIGN	drop fk constraints before dropping any tables. otherwise we may drop the child table prior to dropping it s fks which would be an error. todo this should be done in the dialect s gettabledropsql method for a database specific handling or ignoring of this problem.
DESIGN	silently ignore what could we do anyway?
DESIGN	todo figure out why the selection of the root node in the object tree is undone if we don t delay. it seems like some other thread racing to set the selected node to none. when this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when a session is first opened or when an objecttree frame is created. this is a really crappy and unreliable way to fix this problem but it hides the problem for now. a better understanding of the architecture of session creation is required before a proper solution can be attempted. rmm 20051217
DESIGN	todo temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido s fix assertequals second stmt sep qt2.getsqlstatementseparator
DESIGN	todo maybe we should have a checkbox to allow the user to toggle default value on off. some dbs like db2 treat empty string as a different default value than null.
DESIGN	check the error stream for a problem this is a bit questionable since it is possible for processes to output something on stderr but continue processing. but without this some problems are not seen e.g. bad argument type messages from the process .
DESIGN	ok this is a hack. currently when precision scale i have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data. the problem comes when the source db s precision scale are greater or reported to be greater than the precision scale of the destination db. in this case it maximimizes both for the destination causing a definition that allows 0 digits to the left of the decimal. trouble is without looking at the actual data there is no way to tell if this is valid in some cases it will be ok 0.0000000789 in others it will not be ok 100.123 . so for now make the scale be approx. one half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases.
DESIGN	????? if desired get fancy and use icons in buttons instead of text ?????????
DESIGN	todo when jdk1.4 is the earliest jdk supported by squirrel then remove the hardcoding of the boolean data type.
DESIGN	todo this should be handled with an iterator
DESIGN	work around some utc and daylight saving offsets
DESIGN	?? is there any way to check for invalid input? valid input includes ?? at least any printable character but could it also include unprintable ?? characters?
DESIGN	todo these 2 should be handled with an iterator.
DESIGN	this is a logically not sufficent try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the jdbc api doc statement.getresultset this method should be called only once per result. statement.getupdatecount this method should be called only once per result. statement.getmoreresults there are no more results when the following is true !getmoreresults getupdatecount 1 if getmoreresults returns false we don t know if we have more results we only know that it isn t a result set. since we called getupdatecount before getmoreresults because we would like to know the update count of the first result we might not be allowed to call getupdatecount again. the intersystems cache driver for example always returns the same updatecount on simple insert update delete statements not matter if getmoreresults was called. so updatecount never gets 1 and this will loop forever. when i discussed the issue with the intersystems people they just told me not to call getupdatecount twice. that simple. my hope is that this will cure problems with dbs that just don t care for multiple result sets.
DESIGN	required otherwise it gets too wide.
DESIGN	the call here is the result of a desperate fight to find a place where the components in the split had not height 0. if someone knows a better way please tell me i ll apreciate any advice. gerdwagner users.sourceforge.net
DESIGN	todo what i really want to do here is get the sql script and replace. create procedure with alter procedure then put that in the sql pane. and not execute it.
DESIGN	todo should i be adding quotes if user wants identifiers quoted??
DESIGN	the following ugly conversion from text to byte is necessary because the byte class is inconsistant. when asked to output as hex it does so as an unsigned byte but when asked to read back the same thing using the hex radix it insists that the input must be signed. to get around this we up size the conversion to integer then truncate that to a byte and finally convert the byte to a byte. yech.
DESIGN	this should just bring back one table i hope.
DESIGN	todo temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido s fix iquerytokenizer qt2 sessionundertest.getquerytokenizer
DESIGN	hack to deal with firebird s rdb meta tables.
DESIGN	hack to deal with axion axion tables.
DESIGN	handle mouse events for double click creation of popup dialog. this happens only in the jtextfield not the jtextarea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the keytexthandler class.
DESIGN	don t use tinyint for now even though mckoi supports it. it s notion of tinyint is 7 bit not 8 bit so it is not compatible with other dbs and leads to overflow resulting in negative values which are a corruption of the actual value inserted updated . this is not a great work around. i filed a bug report on the mailing list hopefully it will get fixed soon.
DESIGN	todo need to define a better approach to getting dialects. that is we don t really want to ever prompt the user in this case. it s always oracle. yet we may have a new oracledialect at some point.
DESIGN	evil hack to split the vacuum output a little.
DESIGN	. this code icommand code displays a dialog box that allows the user to. enter a where clause or an order by clause used when getting data via. the contents tab.. . author a href mailto mjhammel users.sourceforge.net maury hammel a . . todo change name to contentstabfiltercommand.
DESIGN	todo col add method to databasemetadata that returns array of objects for getbestrowidentifier. for postgresql put this kludge in the new function. this way all the kludges are kept in one place. kludge!!!!!! for some dbs e.g. postgresql there is actually a pseudo column providing the rowid but the getbestrowidentifier function is not implemented. this kludge hardcodes the knowledge that specific dbs use a specific pseudo column. additionally as of pg 8.1 you must create the table using with oid appended to the create statement. otherwise oid column is not available by default.
DESIGN	this is a work around for what looks like a bug to me it is a syntax error to qualify with the schema the new table name but not the old as in alter table public . tablerenametest rename to public . tablewasrenamed the second public . is apparently not currently a valid thing to do.
DESIGN	skip formatting for stored procedures they can have comments embedded in them and i m presently not sure how the formatter handles this.
DESIGN	??need to tell object to display itself in a panel.
DESIGN	all of the following have been converted to use the datatype objects so why not just have case types.null and default??? this seems pointless rmm 20070726
DESIGN	?? need to associate a panel with an object type somehow.
DESIGN	. . . implement idatasetupdateablemodel interface. and idatasetupdateabletablemodel interface. . todo this code was copied from contentstab. it should probably. be put into a common location and shared by both this. class and contentstab.. . .
DESIGN	todo how to let the user customize this??
DESIGN	. cse moved this code down here to fix repaint problems on first. display bounds should be set before install. . uninstall the old popup from root pane. and install the new one. even in case. they are the same objects it s necessary. to cover the workspace switches etc..
DESIGN	todo rename to datasetviewerpropertydestination
DESIGN	discovered that the loginame field can be null in that case how to know we have the correct view?
DESIGN	this refactoring depends on the following dialect api methods getupdatesql
DESIGN	. todo this shouldn t be public. its only been done for the jcomplete. plugin. at some stage this method will be returned to package visibility..
DESIGN	some dbs like mckoi make 1 the default for scale. apply the same hack as above.
DESIGN	. todo move to ioutilities. . see net.sourceforge.squirrel sql.client.update.updateutil createzipfile filewrapper filewrapper .
DESIGN	. todo work out why. kludge for some reason i am not able to get the sheet to. size correctly. it always displays with a size that causes. the sub panels to have their scrollbars showing. add a bit. of an increase in the size of the panel so the scrollbars. are not displayed..
DESIGN	this is a bit hard coded but if we use scale here some number displays go crazy.
DESIGN	if sql executing produced warnings then write them out to the session message handler. todo this is a pain. postgresql sends raise notice messages to the connection not to the statment so they will be mixed up with warnings from other statements.
DESIGN	?? best guess read object? ?? this is probably the wrong thing to do here but ?? i don t know what else to try.
DESIGN	hack to deal with ingres iie meta tables.
DESIGN	this is a bit hard coded but if we use scale here some number displays go crazy. numberformat.setmaximumfractiondigits scale
DESIGN	todo spatial and fulltext indexes require a myisam engine for the table. is there a way to tell what engine is being used for a table? it may not be necessary since the following doens t hurt if already a myisam engine alter table my table engine myisam still this is not the kind of thing we would want to do automatically since myisam engine is non transactional. we will probably need to tell the user somehow that they need this otherwise the create index statement will fail. maybe a comment in the script and if they happen to read it they could uncomment the conversion of the engine? maybe a custom dialog?

DESIGN	jason make menu smarter. when second window for the same session is added create a hierarchical menu for all windows for the session.
DESIGN	. todo clean this mess up!!!! load plugins. load all plugin jars into class loader..
DESIGN	for some reason when the oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the tabpnl s first tab ends up being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab. this causes the tabs length to be 1 tab greater than the tabs that are actually in the tabpnl. this throws off the selection such that the tab selected in the tab panel doesn t get rendered until the tab to the right of the selected tab is selected. this is a work around for this problem until i can determine why the databaseobjectinfotab never makes it into the tabpnl in the first place.
DESIGN	the following is a work around for the problem on mac os x where the apple laf delegates to the swing popup factory but then tries to set a 90 alpha on the underlying cocoa window which will always be null if you re using jgoodies l f see http www.caimito.net pebble 2005 07 26 1122392314480.html comment1127522262179 this has no effect on linux windows
DESIGN	no appropriate datatype for this column so do the best we can with what we know. this may not be the best behavior here!!!!!!!
DESIGN	coldefs not in same order as db so search for matching coldef entry note linear search here will normally be not too bad because most tables do not have huge numbers of columns.
DESIGN	todo what about these viewport.font colorchooser.font internalframe.font optionpane.font panel.font scrollpane.font desktopicon.font
DESIGN	don t use real type. axion sets the column size to 12 by default yet it can handle more precision. so data being copied from the real column can potentially be larger than what the column claims to support. this will be a problem for other databases that pay attention to the column size. todo perhaps re introduce the real type but use the new getprecisiondigits to max out the precision.
DESIGN	the following only works if swingutilities.getroot table returns and instanceof basemdiparentframe. if swingtuilities.getroot table returns and instance of dialog or frame then other code must be used.
DESIGN	this info is merely a placeholder in the tree that we can use to get index name and parent name more easily. we probably should create a indexcolumninfo that has this extra info in it.
DESIGN	todo should the constraint name simply be the column name or something more like a constraint name?
DESIGN	some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others do not. jdbc on some dbmss does not handle pseudo columns correctly . also gettables returns views as well as tables so the thing we are looking at might not be a table. jdbc does not give a simple way to determine what we are looking at since the type of object is described in a dbms specific encoding. for these reasons rather than testing for all these conditions we just try using the pseudo column info to get the table data and if that fails we try to get the table data without using the pseudo column. todo should we change the mode from editable to non editable?
DESIGN	todo maybe instead of throwing an exception we could ask the user if they would like us to adjust their preference for them.
DESIGN	hack some dbs like frontbase don t support boolean types. i ve tried tinyint bit and boolean as the column type and setboolean fails for all three. it s a mystery at this point what column the getboolean setboolean methods actually work on iin frontbase.
DESIGN	work around for this driver which must have dbo for schema. the. jconnect family of drivers appears to not be affected and can accept a. null schema which is necessary to find tables in other schemas within. the same catalog. similarly jtds 1.2.2 doesn t require this yet it. doesn t return non dbo schema tables unfortunately. .
DESIGN	. a dialect delegate for the progress database. todo progress specification says that the sum of all column. lengths of a table row may not exceed 31960. need to add an interface method to the hibernatedialect. interface that takes an array of lengths and and checks the sum of columns for a row. this maximum number. may be different across databases so this check method needs to be implemented by each dialect.. . author manningr.
DESIGN	todo decide whether this should be a bound property or not. getpropertychangereporter .firepropertychange isqldriver.ipropertynames.name name name
DESIGN	. end kludge.
DESIGN	hack to deal with sybase s sys tables
DESIGN	. todo move all code other than for window creation up to aliaswindowmanager. factory to handle creation of maintenance sheets for sql alias objects.. . author a href mailto colbell users.sourceforge.net colin bell a .
DESIGN	todo why shouldn t we call registersqldriver here? rmm 20070401
DESIGN	todo should have session listeners instead of these calls.
DESIGN	todo just noticed that mysql 5.0 supports a multi bit bit column by using the getobject setobject methods with a byte . so it would be valuable at some point to make this code a bit more dbms specific
DESIGN	. todo move all code other than for window creation up to aliaswindowmanager. factory to handle creation of maintenance sheets for sql driver objects.. . author a href mailto colbell users.sourceforge.net colin bell a .
DESIGN	on win 2000 xp mnemonics are normally hidden. to make them visible you press the alt key. under the windows l f pressing alt may not work. this code is a workaround. see bug report 4736093 for more information.
DESIGN	todo once we re happy that jfcutilities is no longer required
DESIGN	work around for bug which means we must use dbo for schema
DESIGN	todo is this right???
DESIGN	unfortunately we need to remove the exising tree table component and create a new one due to limitations with replacing models in the existing sun implementation. why on earth they couldnt formalise the tree table example on jfc which we use a bit more is anyones guess.
DESIGN	todo figure out why bind variables aren t working
DESIGN	todo make properties file application.properties so we can use class name to generate properties file name.
DESIGN	hack!!! hopefully the fk name will always be the last token!
DESIGN	todo need to have a generic hibernate dialect extend this to provide the types.
DESIGN	this could perhaps more elegantly be done by recursion
DESIGN	??? for now use the same renderer as everyone else. ?? ?? in future change this to use a new instance of renederer ?? for this data type.
DESIGN	. todo get rid of this class.. this combobox contains all the columns in an sql table.. . author a href mailto colbell users.sourceforge.net colin bell a .
DESIGN	todo make parameter implement sqlitem interface which has a getstring method which can also be implemented by sqlstring or sqlfragment or some such. we can then eliminate the use of instanceof below and clean up the code a bit by making itemsinsql look like arraylist sqlitem itemsinsql new arraylist sqlitem
DESIGN	todo spring inject when this class is a spring bean
DESIGN	h2 uses java classes that implement the trigger interface to operate on database tables rows when an action triggers them. therefore there is currently no way to access the source for a trigger. hopefully this will change at some point in the future. treeapi.adddetailtab databaseobjecttype.trigger new triggersourcetab the source of the trigger
DESIGN	?? split these 4 functions off into a subclass of basefavouriteaction
DESIGN	arrays of strings are a special case. in xmlbeanwriter method processproperty an array of strings is turned into a list of stringwrapper objects in the xml presumably so that when reading them back we have a class that we can call setters on . thus when reading back an array of strings we actually read an array of stringwrappers which gives a type mis match in the following arraycopy. therefore we need to convert the data that is currently in the stringwrapper objects into actual strings.
DESIGN	. todo move this to ioutilities extracts the specified zip file to the specified output directory.. . param zipfile. param outputdirectory. throws ioexception.
DESIGN	should probably create my own table model but i am being a bit slack.
DESIGN	. set the password for this alias.. . param password the new password.. . throws validationexception. todo what conditions?.
DESIGN	tell caller that the underlying data was not updated ?? is this always true or could the data be updated with a warning?
DESIGN	empty string seems to be represented as null in some drivers. not sure if this is the best thing to do here but it fixes an issue where sql returns is set default to when it is already null.
DESIGN	todo hard coded . jdbc odbc bridge jdk1.4 brings back 9 for nvarchar columns in ms sql server tables. 8 is rowid in oracle.
DESIGN	todo pass in a message handler so user gets error msgs.
DESIGN	facade methods for imessagehandler. we don t want to allow code to directly access an internal imessagehandler now that the imessagehandler interface requires an exceptionformatter to be injected for methods that accept exceptions.
DESIGN	jason mow that multiple object trees exist storing the edit where by objectinfo within session won t work. it needs to be objectinfo within something else. private final map editwherecolssheets new hashmap
DESIGN	todo put in all the property accessors
DESIGN	db delete worked correctly so now delete from table important the user and the creator both work through the sortabletablemodel not the actual model. thus the row indexes to delete are given in the sortabletablemodel row numbers so we must work through that model model to actually do the delete.
DESIGN	set the property values note this may have already been done by another instance of this datatype created to handle a different column.
DESIGN	todo do we need this one.
DESIGN	todo figure out a more reliable way to handle other type which indicates a database specific type.
DESIGN	todo is giving a fk constraint a name universally supported and done the same way on every database?
DOCUMENTATION	. todo javadoc. . author colin bell.
DOCUMENTATION	. this class manages the windows for the application.. . todo correct these notes. p when a session closes the window manager will ensure that. all of the windows for that sesion are closed.. p similarily when a window is closed the windows manager will ensure that. references to the window are removed for the session.. . jason prior to this patch there was some code movement from this class to. sessionmanager. the idea being that sessionmanager was the controller.. do we still want to do this? remember in the future there will probably be. an sdi as well as mdi version of the windows.. . author a href mailto colbell users.sourceforge.net colin bell a . author a href mailto jmheight users.sourceforge.net jason height a .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo sort the list.

IMPLEMENTATION	. called when app shutdown.. todo put throws clause back in.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tooltips
IMPLEMENTATION	todo fillfactor on primary etc.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo allow the user to specify ignore case or preserve case.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo when message are can have some text in red error and some normal then put out errors in red.

IMPLEMENTATION	todo on primary
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe prompt the user to ask to append the records ignoring errors for constraint violations?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo refresh
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe someday we could inform the user that the imported key can t be created because the list of tables they ve selected doesn t include the table that this foreign key depends upon. for now just log a warning and skip it.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i18n
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo hookup with interbase spec and adjust these as necessary. .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo figure out how to get then name of the table that the trigger is on. and tables.name ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should also make sure that each of the columns is made not null
IMPLEMENTATION	. sorts the specified destinfos array based on the order of the sourceinfos. array. not a very efficient algorthim but it gets the job done.. todo rewrite this using collections sorting capability.. . param sourceinfos. param destinfos. param sourcetablename. param desttablename. return a re ordered version of the specified destinfos array. throws mappingexception if the arrays differ in length or column names..
IMPLEMENTATION	todo perhaps we can tell the user when they click copy table if the source session is axion and they want primary keys that it s not possible.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if the use checks export entire table and doesn t select all then the selected indices are not set and this check doesn t properly detect missing data. if export entire table is selected we need to set the selected indexes below correctly.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo create the child index st
IMPLEMENTATION	we just copied the last table. now it is safe to copy the constraints. well that is if all fk dependencies are met in the group of tables being copied. todo new feature could be to examine table list for fk s in tables not in the list then prompt the user to add those missing tables to the list.
IMPLEMENTATION	. a dialect delegate for the axion database. . todo this dialect is not yet complete. need to provide implementations wherever not yet implemented . appears. .
IMPLEMENTATION	todo allow the user to specify the sequence name for dialects that don t natively support auto increment columns without using sequence trigger combo.
IMPLEMENTATION	. todo finish i18n.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to enhance the index dialog to allow specifying storage option. for now just accept the default for the index access method. valuesmap.put indextype using btree
IMPLEMENTATION	todo put throws clause back in empty method.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo?? columndisplaydefinition should also have the type string date double integer boolean
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to add storageoptions to the add index dialog valuesmap.put st storage option key
IMPLEMENTATION	move any i18n files that are located in the core downloads dir to the i18n downloads dir. the spring application context will not load properly for some unknown reason when there are i18n jars in the classpath. so as a work around we simply ensure that they are where they should be anyway. previously we were not as careful about this so it is possible that i18n jars were copied into the core downloads directory.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this better
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to implement or change the message
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to allow user to specify this

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is handy to have the cannonical path name to show user in error messages. since getting that name might involve an ioexception we need to put it inside a try statement. however since the file does exist there is no good reason for getting an ioexception at this point but if we get one there is something seriously wrong and we want to abort. therefore it make sense to get that name here and save it for later use.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	bad export do not proceed with command the exportdata method has already put up a message to the user saying the export failed.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datatypes may limit the initial data read from the db e.g. to minimize the time needed for the initial load of the table. to edit the contents of a cell we require that the entire contents of the data element be present in the cell before editing. therefore we ask the datatype if we need to re read the data contents without limiting it and do that read if needed. if there is a problem during the read e.g. we cannot identify exactly one row in the db matching the current row in the table then the cell is not editable. the reverse is not true if we succeed in reading the data there may still be other reasons why we cannot edit it so we need to check for it being editable after the read

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. for oracle 10g we could say something like . . where xmlserialize content coldef.getlabel like value . . this doesn t appear to work on oracle 9i at the moment so we will. avoid using this column in any where clause if the value is non null . which is what the superclass implementation does.. . todo find a way to do this for both versions or split this behavior. so that it works on 10g and is disabled on 9i..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	go through each child of the parent and see if it was previously expanded. if it was recursively call this method in order to expand the child.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	to allow the fw to save and reload user options related to specific columns we construct a unique name for the table so the column can be associcated with only that table. some drivers do not provide the catalog or schema info so those parts of the name will end up as null. that s ok since this string is never viewed by the user and is just used to distinguish this table from other tables in the db. we also include the url used to connect to the db so that the same table db on different machines is treated differently.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the release version doesn t change we won t be pulling down core artifacts. so we just need to make sure that all core files have been copied from their installed locations into the corresponding directory in download which is in the classpath of the updater. this covers the case where the update is being run for the first time after install and no new version is available but the user wants to install remove plugins and or translations.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the list of specific column names is in comma separated format with a comma in front of the first entry as well empty the map of old values

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	alter table tablename add constraint null field check field is not null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default behavior if no appropriate data type found is to create a simple jtextarea with no special handling. in theory this cannot happen because if there is no data type object for this column s data type then iseditableinpopup returns false so we should not get here. if there is a data type object and iseditableinpopup returns true then we would have executed the return statement above. assume that the value can be represented as a string.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reasons for this code mailed to rob by gerd on 9 20 2008. the problem are methods like basesqlentrypanel.getboundsofsqltobeexecuted basesqlentrypanel.movecarettoprevioussqlbegin they rely on the line break being a single char. also i suppose some of our code generation scripting functions do the same. at least i m pretty sure if r n would be preserved they could produce a mixture of n and r n.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. if the object representing the actual data i.e. this object . can be edited by the user then the fw objects need to have. a reference to it. updateable objects must implement an. interface derived from idatasetupdateablecomponent in the. net.sourceforge.squirrel sql.fw.datasetviewer package.. if the component does not implement that interface . then we just keep going but if it does implement it . then we need to tell the datasetscrollingpanel that the. object that fw needs to call is this one..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	increases component width by 20 pixels
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there are some fields that cannot be used in a where clause either because there cannot be an exact match e.g. real float or because we may not have the actual data in hand blob clob or because the data cannot be expressed in a string form e.g. binary . an update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row because we can only see the fields that we know how to do wheres on . therefore when we are updating them there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria we hope . we determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the where clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the where clause. any field that can be used there will return something of the form fieldname value and a field that cannot be used will return a null or zero length string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add more space to the top of the component

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note a caseinsensitivestring can be a mutable string. in fact it is a mutable string here because this is usually called from within syntax coloring which uses a mutable string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	copyonwritearraylist is unfortunately not sort able as a list. so this will throw an unsupportedoperationexception collections.sort itableinfos new tableinfosimplenamecomparator the following is the best approach according to concurrency master doug lea in this post http osdir.com ml java.jsr.166 concurrency 2004 06 msg00001.html here we copy the existing internal array into a new array that is large enough to hold the original and new elements. then sort it. and finally create a new copyonwritearraylist with the sorted array.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use all of the columns
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. when user leaves a cell after editing it the contents of. that cell need to be converted from a string into an. object of the appropriate type before updating the table.. however when the call comes from the popup window the data. has already been converted and validated.. we assume that a string being passed in here is a value from. a text field that needs to be converted to an object and. a non string object has already been validated and converted..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save various info about the column for use in user input validation when editing table contents. note that the columndisplaysize is included two times where the first entry may be adjusted for actual display while the second entry is the size expected by the db. the isnullable method returns three values that we convert into two by saying that if it is not known whether or not a column allows nulls we will allow the user to enter nulls and any problems will be caught when they try to save the data to the db
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	implement the idatasettablecontrols interface functions needed to support table operations these functions are called from within myjtable and mytable to tell those classes how to operate. the code in these functions will be different depending on whether the table is read only or editable. the definitions below are for read only operation. the editable table panel overrides these functions with the versions that tell the tables how to set up for editing operations.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle mouse events for double click creation of popup dialog. this happens only in the jtextfield not the jtextarea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the keytexthandler class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if use is not looking for ascii chars or if this one is one that is not printable then convert it into numeric form
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clobs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the db is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself. during the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read therefore we do not need to re read the datum from the database because we know that we have the entire descriptor. if the contents of the clob have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we want to detect two empty text values in a row before we decide to restore the original value. since text contains the new value we want to allow the first empty text so that the user can clear the field and on the second one we will set it to the original value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tables that are netiher children nor parents utility tables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	. now the popup related methods. these are not quite symmetric with the. in cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to. display in the popup is handled internally to the datatype object inside. getjtextarea so we do not need a renderobjectinpopup function. visible to the rest of the world..

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since we can use a correlated sub query to update all rows in one statement we don t care about the set values unless fromtables is null in which case we go with a normal update. using the set values would require an update statement for each row in the merged table for each column that was merged in which is incredibly inefficient. however the api is intended to support database dialects that can t handle correlated sub queries.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	oracle declares the column size to be 4000 regardless of the maximum length of the clob field. so if the oracle blob clob column contains values that exceed 4000 chars and we use colinfo.getcolumnsize we might create a destination column that is too small for the data that will be copied from oracle. we specify a default value of 4000 in case the table has no records or if the blob clob column contains only null values.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is always thrown as said in embedded derby api. so it is not error it is info
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	value is a simple string representation of the data but not the same one used in the text and in cell operations. the in cell version may replace newline chars with n while this version does not. in other respects it is the same as the in cell version because both use the renderer object to do the rendering.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are limiting some things. if the string we have is less than the limit then we are ok and do not need to re read because we already have the whole thing .
