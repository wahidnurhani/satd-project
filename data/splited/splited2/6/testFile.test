DEFECT	fixme i doubt any of the constants referenced in this method are ever redefined -- should compare to the known values rather than do an expensive constant lookup.
DEFECT	fixme arg may also be true false and nil and still be valid. strangely enough protocol conversion is not happening in ruby on this arg?
DEFECT	fixme we have cloned the chart but the dataset(s) are not cloned and we should do that
DEFECT	fixme correct year calculation
DEFECT	fixme check how ruby 1.9 handles this
DEFECT	walk up the scope tree right now as much as possible to avoid run-time walking sss fixme any reason why this might break in the presence of ruby's dynamic resolution? what might break?
DEFECT	vulture thread will periodically expunge dead entries. entries are also expunged during 'put' operations this is designed to cover the case where many objects are created initially followed by limited put activity. fixme disabled (below) pending resolution of finalization issue
DEFECT	todo make sure it is really safe to not to copy it
DEFECT	todo this requires that the collection is defined after the referenced property in the mapping file (ok?)
DEFECT	todo does not work for entitymode.dom4j yet!
DEFECT	todo not sure which (either?) is correct could not find docs on how to do this. did find various blogs and forums mentioning that select current_timestamp does not work
DEFECT	note that this implementation is kind of broken for components with many-to-one associations
DEFECT	use special cheats that speed up the code (currently about 50%) but may because problems with future maintenance and add to the class file size (about 500 bytes).
DEFECT	if it exists remove it and add it at the end (avoid memory leak)
DEFECT	fix for this bug -- put a mode into the user dir with the same name as one on the system dir. -- reload edit modes. -- old mode from system dir still used for highlighting until jedit restart.
DEFECT	while its broken to have a null symlinkpath some older plugins might
DEFECT	sss fixme for constant arrays we should never get here!
DEFECT	todo why does the next part not work?
DEFECT	todo only occurrence of isconcurrent in uml 2.1.1 is in index it is not on the page that is indexed
DEFECT	strange but the link.getconnection() * returns a collection not a list! * this is a bug compared to the uml standard (imho mvw). * hence the linkend is added to the end instead
DEFECT	"* this will not work on derby where non-varchar columns cannot be altered * among other restrictions. * * tablecolumninfo nullintvc = getvarcharcolumn(""nullint"" true ""defval"" * ""a varchar comment"") string altercoltypesql = * dialect.getcolumntypealtersql(firstcol nullintvc) runsql(session * altercoltypesql)"
DEFECT	todo may not work on all oses?
DEFECT	* urgent todo - sort out equals and hashcode() - at present equal * instances can/will have different hashcodes - problem is when a proper * hashcode is used tests stop working e.g. listener data disappears when * switching views this presumably means that instances currently * regarded as equal are not really equal. * * @see java.lang.objecthashcode()
DEFECT	these do not appear to work. rowheadertablecol1.setresizable(true) rowheadertablecol2.setresizable(true) cornertablecol1.setresizable(true) cornertablecol2.setresizable(true)
DEFECT	"todo setup title correctly. settitle(gettitle() + "" "" + _session.getsessionsheet().gettitle())"
DEFECT	the next line does not work
DEFECT	if we have anything or multiple elements selected we do not do anything todo we need to support multiple selection. see issue 2552
DEFECT	fixme this is not quite right it should not evaluate the value if it is going to throw the error
DEFECT	todo does anyone use command line? if so localization is needed - tfm
DEFECT	if we are not visible most likely we are being deleted. todo this indicates a more fundamental problem that should be investigated - tfm - 20061230
DEFECT	update attached node figures todo presumably this should only happen on a add or remove event
DEFECT	"todo this does not perform well enough with large models to have it enabled by default. if the performance cannot be improved perhaps we can introduce a manual ""find in explorer tree"" action. selectall(targets)"
DEFECT	todo this only works if the item is visible (all its parents are expanded) getexpandeddescendants makevisible
DEFECT	todo a warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will because some trouble. the parser should definitely be much better.
DEFECT	note at least my local mysql 5.1 install shows this not working
DESIGN	* * returns the root package. * * @return the package which is the root * @deprecated for 0.25.4 by tfmorris - use {@link getroots()} to * get packages/model elements which are at the top level. * * todo we probably need a getdefaultnamespace() method or * something similar to replace some uses of this.

DESIGN	todo currently keeps getters and setters (instead of propertyaccessors) because of the way getgetter() and getsetter() are implemented currently yuck!
DESIGN	this is wrongly called with a null handle as a workaround we return an empty collection
DESIGN	todo why is this not executed? remove if not needed - tfm
DESIGN	andreas just temporary for the uml2 pre-alpha versions!
DESIGN	* * todo this class should be moved to package * org.argouml.uml.ui.behavior.common_behavior.

DESIGN	todo without the null check the following throws a npe so many times when it is called from figedgemodelelement.modelchanged() we need to think about it.
DESIGN	"todo this should be more extensible may be only ""findpanelfor(target)"" if there is a panel why not show it?"

DESIGN	how much control should critics have over when they are relavant? does doing that in code instead of declaratively limit reasoning? how does using more semantically rich method calls impact componentization?
DESIGN	todo once we have fixed all subclasses the title will always be localized so this localization can be removed.
DESIGN	* since this is (hopefully) a temporary solution and nobody ever looks * at the type of notation event we can simplify from sending every * existing event to one event only. but since there is no catch-all * event defined we just make one up. rationale reduce the number of * total refreshes of the drawing.

DESIGN	todo is there anyway we can determine this size at runtime?
DESIGN	"todo we also have code registering for the names of a tagged value like ""derived"""
DESIGN	todo because we get called on each and every change event when the model is in a state of flux we will often get an invalidelementexception before we finish this collection. the only saving grace is that we are called so many times that on the last time things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update. we need a better mechanism.
DESIGN	todo split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly in this class.
DESIGN	* * class to display graphics for a uml choice state in a diagram - the circle. * * todo this should really be renamed figchoicestate. it is the * last vestige of the uml 1.3 name. * * @author pepargouml
DESIGN	todo needs to be tidied up after stable release. graph model should be created in constructor
DESIGN	"todo this code appears to be designed to jump to the diagram containing the contents of the package that was double clicked but it looks like it is always searching for the name ""main"" instead of the package name. todo but in any case it should be delegating this work to to something that knows about the diagrams and they contents -tfm"
DESIGN	* todo is this required? why would the fig already be dashed? * * @see org.tigris.gef.presentation.figedgesetfig( * org.tigris.gef.presentation.fig)

DESIGN	todo this creates a dependency on the critics subsystem. we need a generic way for modules (including our internal subsystems) to request addition of actions to the popup menu. - tfm 20080430
DESIGN	* * this node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other * fignodes in argouml. it is actually an optional child fig (or more precisely * a path item) of a figedgemodelelement. * this allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the * association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a * comment to some other edge type. * gef can only attach edges to nodes by making this fig both a node and * containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge * connections. * todo we are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we do not really * require. we should attempt to make figedgeport extend fignode. * * @author bob tarling
DESIGN	todo the above populate works but seems rather heavy here. i can see something like this is needed though as events will not manage this quick enough. could we make figeditablecompartment.createmodelelement() create the new child fig instance? it may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return - bob.
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml permission. * * @return an initialized uml permission instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created. * @deprecated for 0.27.3 by tfmorris. renamed in uml 2.x to packageimport. * use {@link createpackageimport()}.
DESIGN	code also allows for lf only (not sure why - perhaps because the test code uses it?)

DESIGN	todo merge put and post methods as far as possible. e.g. post checks for multipart form/files and if not invokes senddata(
DESIGN	todo - should the encoding be configurable? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	todo probably not needed
DESIGN	should we return fragment as text rather than text of fragment?
DESIGN	todo should this be jtlsaver? only seems to be called by monitorhealthvisualzer
DESIGN	todo move this to components -- the only reason why it is in core is because it is used as a guinea pig by a couple of tests.
DESIGN	this is ugly here but needed because its a subquery
DESIGN	todo should this throw an error?
DESIGN	this can lead to code smell meh! do we care
DESIGN	todo should this implement supportscustomeditor() ?
DESIGN	does not appear to be used yet
DESIGN	todo - does not appear to be called directly
DESIGN	todo should this be restored?
DESIGN	todo - why use space?
DESIGN	todo should class implement samplelistener?
DESIGN	todo does it matter that an empty line will terminate the loop? csv output files should never contain empty lines so probably not if so then need to check whether the reader is at eof
DESIGN	this is used by sessionfactoryimpl to hand to the generated sessionimpl was the only reason i could see that we cannot just use null as settings.cacheprovider
DESIGN	use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug
DESIGN	todo i am not so sure about the exception handling in this bit!

DESIGN	todo if object was an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two sql selects
DESIGN	"todo make this the factory for ""entity mode related"" sessions also means making this the target of transaction-synch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions at that point perhaps this thing is a ""sessioncontext"" and connectionmanager is a ""jdbccontext""? a ""sessioncontext"" should live in the impl package"
DESIGN	todorefactor + make this method private

DESIGN	hack some dbs (like frontbase) do not support boolean types. I have tried tinyint bit and boolean as the column type and setboolean fails for all three. it is a mystery at this point what column the getboolean/setboolean methods actually work on iin frontbase.
DESIGN	the following is a work-around for the problem on mac os x where the apple laf delegates to the swing popup factory but then tries to set a 90% alpha on the underlying cocoa window which will always be null if you are using jgoodies l&f see this has no effect on linux/windows
DESIGN	todo once we are happy that jfcutilities is no longer required
DESIGN	todo put in all the property accessors
DESIGN	arrays of strings are a special case. in xmlbeanwriter method processproperty an array of strings is turned into a list of stringwrapper objects in the xml (presumably so that when reading them back we have a class that we can call setters on). thus when reading back an array of strings we actually read an array of stringwrappers which gives a type mis-match in the following arraycopy. therefore we need to convert the data that is currently in the stringwrapper objects into actual strings.
DESIGN	todo make properties file application.properties so we can use class name to generate properties file name.
DESIGN	"check the error stream for a problem this is a bit questionable since it is possible for processes to output something on stderr but continue processing. but without this some problems are not seen (e.g. ""bad argument"" type messages from the process)."

DESIGN	fixme no getvalueformat() method?
DESIGN	create entities fixme these methods should be defined
DESIGN	todo implement properly
DESIGN	the label is not used.
DESIGN	todo this is really quite attrocious since there is code that will assume an iterator that returns strings!
DESIGN	todo this is faster than many charat() calls.
DESIGN	todo I would much rather have this done from endloadingcollection(collectionpersisterloadingcollectionentry)
DESIGN	this class has no proxies (so do a shortcut)
DESIGN	fb tbd can we come up with a better algorithm for choosing the default label feature?
DESIGN	* * provides query splitting methods which were originally in querytranslator. * * todo this will need to be refactored at some point. * * @author josh

DESIGN	todo stop polling thread?!
DESIGN	todo better way?!?
DESIGN	defer argument checking
DESIGN	fixme need a locale as well as a timezone
DESIGN	here we tweak the notify flag on the plot so that only one notification happens even though we update multiple axes
DESIGN	fixme (@author fdietz) do we need this implementation in a tempfolder? if not just put an empty method here just like in virtualfolder.
DESIGN	todo let the attachmentviewer get the focus so that this works
DESIGN	todo @author fdietz no paging used currently show only first 5 results
DESIGN	todo @author fdietz ensure that we do not fetch individual headers to reduce client/server roundtrips
DESIGN	todoadd a configuration of the cache size
DESIGN	todo there is probably a better way to do this hack
DESIGN	we cannot use systemclassloader here because that would not work with java webstart resourcebundle uses its own internal classloader if no classloader is given -> set classloader = null
DESIGN	simplified these settings a little
DESIGN	note this implementation is temporary. we currently keep a flat namespace of the base name of classes. i.e. beanshell cannot be in the process of defining two classes in different packages with the same base name. to remove this limitation requires that we work through namespace imports in an analogous (or using the same path) as regular class import resolution. this workaround should handle most cases so we will try it for now.
DESIGN	"this next bit is to allow for both unsaved-value=""negative"" and for ""older"" behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object todo shift it into unsaved-value strategy"
DESIGN	static methods that operate on compound ('.' separated) names i guess we could move these to stringutil someday
DESIGN	todo to get cast and boxing working e.g. e.g. byte [] ia = { 1 2 } if the basetype is a wrapper type then we need to get the primitive type class for the base type here in order for the cast to allow it then boxing will happen naturally in the array.set(). e.g. integer [] ia = { 1 2 }
DESIGN	should use try/finally here to pop ns
DESIGN	for sets we should end the collection load after resolving the entities since we might call hashcode() on the elements todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	does this dialect support the oracle-style for update nowait syntax?
DESIGN	does this dialect support the unique column syntax?
DESIGN	use count as the default. this mimics the old behavior although none might be a better option moving forward in the case of callable
DESIGN	"todo should ""record"" how many properties we have reffered to - and if we do not get'them'all we throw an exception! way better than trial and error )"
DESIGN	todo assumes all collections disassemble to an array!
DESIGN	todo this is very suboptimal for some subclasses (namely components) since it does not take advantage of two-phase-load
DESIGN	stupid hack to handle referencing a rule set that is defined later!
DESIGN	this should probably be in reflect.java
DESIGN	first try for an accessible version of the exact match. this first lookup seems redundant with below but is apparently needed. this whole thing is messy.
DESIGN	stupidity
DESIGN	split the methods into constructors and regular method lists
DESIGN	on windows paths of the form x list the last *working * directory* on that drive. to list the root of the drive * you must use x\. * * however the vfs browser and friends strip off trailing * path separators for various reasons. so to work around * that we add a '\' to drive letter paths on windows.
DESIGN	resolve relative to a class type static field inner class ?
DESIGN	we consume this to work around the bug where a+tab window switching activates the menu bar on windows.
DESIGN	do not try this at home
DESIGN	cut off from parent we must have our own class manager. cannot do this in the run() command (needs to resolve stuff) should we do it by default when we create a namespace will no parent of class manager?
DESIGN	hack need a more direct way of obtaining a view? jedittextarea.getview() method?
DESIGN	should probably error
DESIGN	the sooner ppl move to the new api the less we will need crap like this
DESIGN	stupid swing
DESIGN	todo consider a conditional feature in the xml panel def for this
DESIGN	todo part of this is copied from actiondeletemodelelement. we maybe need some subclass for common code.
DESIGN	todo exec should replace the current process. this could be possible with jna.
DESIGN	* todo mvw this needs rethinking/rework! i have the following questions * why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties * and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used? ie why is * there not a getstereotype(string name string baseclass)? (edited by * d00mst) * * @see org.argouml.model.extensionmechanismsfactorybuildstereotype(java.lang.object java.lang.object java.lang.object)
DESIGN	todo this should either be extended to support all aggreationkinds or it should be simplified/removed from the api - tfm - 20070331
DESIGN	"todo delete old multiplicity? why is ""copy"" using hard coded value? - tfm"
DESIGN	"fixme this is currently only here because of some problems with iooutputstream writing to a ""bare"" runtime without a proper scope"
DESIGN	todo make this do specific-arity calling
DESIGN	fixme the code below is a copy of rubyio.puts and we should avoid copy-paste.
DESIGN	todo? i think this ends up propagating from normal java exceptions sys_fail(openfile.getpath())
DESIGN	todo wire into new exception handling mechanism
DESIGN	todo not_allocatable_allocator is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it cannot be marshalled. confirm. jruby-415
DESIGN	fixme what should this really be? assert x instanceof rubycomplex
DESIGN	* * builds a manifestation of an element for an artifact. * * @param utilizedelement is the packageable element * @return manifestation * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.

DESIGN	todo doing this violates the minimal cardinality of 1 if we allow it we at least need a critic to warn about it
DESIGN	* a near clone of this code works fine outside of argouml but throws a * null pointer exception during the transform when run within argouml i * think it is something to do with the class libraries being used but i * cannot figure out what so I have done a simpler less efficient stepwise * translation below in serialtransform
DESIGN	todo this does not belong here - use getimportedelement.
DESIGN	todo moved this out of the implementation-specific piece - tfm everything is primary for now (ie not reverse engineered)
DESIGN	todo we currently delete the old values before setting to something new. this is a workaround to issue 6056. we should consider giving an api to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values.
DESIGN	todo do we really want stereotypes from nested packages?
DESIGN	todo this will need to be adapted to send undo/redo commands back to our consumer (e.g. argouml) if a new undo mechanism is implemented for the model subsystem - tfm
DESIGN	fixme this should probably do some translation from ruby priority levels to java priority levels (until we have green threads)
DESIGN	temporary hack to handle non-ruby values will come up with better solution shortly
DESIGN	sss fixme i could make ir_loop a scope too semantically it is a scope but functionally not sure if this is required yet
DESIGN	we clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block. any previously captured instances of this block may still be around and we do not want to start overwriting those values when we create a new one. enebo once we make self lastclass and lastmethod immutable we can remove duplicate
DESIGN	need to reexamine this
DESIGN	hack in to replace usual readline with this
DESIGN	"todo mri behavior call ""+"" or ""add"" depending on the call. but this leads to exceptions when floats are added. see return callcoerced(context op b true) -- this is mri behavior. we will use ours for now thus providing an ability to add floats."
DESIGN	todo something much better - look at the type of the other expression! todo have comparisonexpression and/or arithmeticexpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes.
DESIGN	try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name. this allows the (we assume custom) interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityname
DESIGN	todo switch statements are always evil! we already had bugs because of forgotten token types. use polymorphism for this!
DESIGN	todo copy/paste from manytoonetype
DESIGN	this is not very nice (and quite slow)
DESIGN	work around a bug in all known connection pools .
DESIGN	this is a fairly specific hack for empty string but it does the job
DESIGN	sss fixme receiver -- this is the class meta object basically? operand receiver = build(defsnode.getreceivernode() s)
DESIGN	todo decompose getjavapackagemodule so we do not parse fullname
DESIGN	entry exists proxy does not match. replace. this could happen if old proxy was gc'ed todo raise exception if stored proxy is non-null? (not gc'ed)
DESIGN	fixme needs to be rethought
DESIGN	we might need to perform a dst correction
DESIGN	todo make this more intelligible value
DESIGN	"if we do not have opt args start after args (they will be assigned later) this is for crap like def foo(a = (b = true 1)) which numbers b before a fixme only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileroot using ""0"" to indicate [] signature."
DESIGN	todo bleeding runtime into parser. arity may be should be in parser (to keep bleeding oneway)
DESIGN	fixme do we really want 'declared' methods? includes private/protected and does _not_ include superclass methods. also the getdeclared calls may throw securityexception if we are running under a restrictive security policy.
DESIGN	yow this is still ugly
DESIGN	xxx const lookup can trigger const_missing is that enough to warrant it always being executed?
DESIGN	fixme this should go somewhere more generic -- maybe idutil
DESIGN	todo remove
DESIGN	this may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities.
DESIGN	xxx maybe use reflection to addpathelement (other patterns ?)
DESIGN	quick fix for ant.java use of property before initializing the project
DESIGN	this is faintly ridiculous

DESIGN	xxx all this to get package according to weblogic standards can be written better this is too hacky! careful.. similar code in scandir but slightly different!!
DESIGN	***hack*** we ask the vm to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the vm to run the class' static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor.

IMPLEMENTATION	todo add ir instructions for checking method arity! s.getvariablecompiler().checkmethodarity(required opt rest)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo draw the interval marker with a 3d effect
IMPLEMENTATION	todo understand qualifiers
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this is a linear search of a list that contain many thousands of items (one for every fig in the entire project)
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme pick one of bytelist or string or add internal conversion methods to convert to the default representation
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme make bodynode non-null in parser
IMPLEMENTATION	additional cleanup needed because this would not be removed by ext.destroy()
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want all enabled tabs to listen or only the one that is selected/visible? - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	reorder submenu todo i think this requires i18n but not sure - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo other reserved names?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo missing additional logic for dealing with conflicting protected fields.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo clone_setup here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo treat message
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other kinds of tail
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if this turns out to be a performance bottleneck we can probably optimize the common case by caching our iterator and current position assuming that the next request will be for a greater index
IMPLEMENTATION	todo work here !
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe a return message already exists. check first and and if the first found has no activator then set this call message as the activator and skip the code below.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what to do with the return value?
IMPLEMENTATION	a language must be unique so select the current empty language. todo ? alert
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we need a better algorithm.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo 2nd next() for single hasnext()
IMPLEMENTATION	todo fully implement this!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo once the default constructor is deleted we only set dirty flag
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby re-checks that the buffer string has not been modified
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better here to continue the loop and try to build the rest of the compartment. hence try/catch should be internal to the loop.
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme add text mode to mode flags
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check the return value here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add referencedclass to disambiguate to fks on the same columns pointing to different tables
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add owner argument!!
IMPLEMENTATION	/ todo look at perhaps caching this
IMPLEMENTATION	todo arithmetic expressions multiple new foo( )
IMPLEMENTATION	if there was any text before this add it as a fragment todo this check could be modified to go if pos>prev seems like this current version could stick empty strings into the list
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo lowercasing done here. was done ""at random"" before maybe not needed at all ?"
IMPLEMENTATION	to do delete the file if it is not a valid file.
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo figure out how to get then name of the table that the trigger is on. ""and tables.name = ? "" +"
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo need to enhance the index dialog to allow specifying storage option. for now just accept the default for the index access method. valuesmap.put(""indextype"" ""using btree"")"
IMPLEMENTATION	"* * a dialect delegate for the sun microsystems hadb (high-availability) database. * todo this dialect is not yet complete. need to provide implementations wherever ""not yet implemented"" * appears. * * @author manningr"
IMPLEMENTATION	todo when message are can have some text in red (error) and some normal then put out errors in red.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should have an image of a wizard or some logo
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tooltips
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why do we need this when we can just change the font and achieve the same effect?
IMPLEMENTATION	how to handle empty target lists? probably the tabtext should only show an empty pane in that case
IMPLEMENTATION	* * todo these can not simply be translated
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add empty placeholder here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement oclexpression
IMPLEMENTATION	skip header bytes maybe should check if they are valid or not?
IMPLEMENTATION	should we exit at end of the test? (only applies to server because host is non-null)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it is a performance drain to load all classes at startup time. they should be lazy loaded when needed. instead of scanning all classes for ones which implement our loadable module interface we should use a manifest entry or a special name/name pattern that we look for to find the single main module class to load here. - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this try-catch will be needed * once the code below is improved.
IMPLEMENTATION	we should be able to find the comma because the range for enum constants includes all preceding comments up to the previous constant if targetsourcerangecomputer of astrewrite changes this logic should change to skip comments see org.eclipse.emf.codegen.merge.java.facade.ast.commentawaresourcerangecomputergetenumconstantsourcerange(astnode)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this removed from uml2 ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo (@author fdietz) i18n
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this a good way of handling nested notation?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ignore for now.
TEST	* todo add tests to check for - name clash - long option abbreviations * (match shortest unique abbreviation)
TEST	"listening only to ""remove"" events does not work * todo check if this works now with new event pump - tfm"
TEST	todo update this after old tests pass and then update the old tests to reflect this change.
TEST	this is the wrong test if the remote os is openvms but there does not seem to be a way to detect it.
TEST	todo do tests for infix operators (8.4.7) even though it is not yet supported
TEST	for some reason listset.equals() allocates a lot of memory well some memory at least. let us try to avoid that when not needed by invoking this test only when the two previous tests are not decisive.
TEST	* * test read compressed models mainly to verify the correct reading of * andromda profiles. * todo move this test into argouml base when we will want to read also zip * file. * * @author lmaitre
TEST	testing does not fire. conflict with crnameconflict.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again both should be fromelements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make @%$^^ sure no alias is applied to the table name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to check even if it was not initialized because of delayed adds!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check the persistence context for an entry relating to this entity to be merged
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	early exit!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the workspace node has null as well ok if not we have been modified in a non-comparable manner which we have to treat as us being newer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays replaceelements() may return a different reference since the array length might not match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not a collection? return the entity property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before cascade!

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	careful these methods do not initialize the collection.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	replace { .} with corresponding column aliases
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	convert the string value into the proper type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	let return-propertys override whatever the persister has for aliases.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check violation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is now handled earlier in this method.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	limit/offset support ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is a formula index use the element columns in the pk
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	prepare the left hand side and get the data type.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	leave a blank line just to make it look a bit nicer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	clear any previous plan
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	truncate string
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	these two columns will be the only ones in the pktest table. they will start out being nullable and we will test that the dialect correctly converts them to non-null then applies the pk constraint to them. this test shall not be run against any database dialect that claims not to support changing the nullability of a column.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	from javax.naming.referenceable
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	persistent collections may have components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to parse off the column qualifiers this is assuming (which is true as of now) that this is only used from update and delete hql statement parsing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	values is not null and is checkable we will look deeper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classic translator does not support collection of ordinal param metadata
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	or types.longvarchar?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	limit support (ala top) ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note evict() operates locally only (i.e. does not propogate to any other nodes in the potential cluster). this is exactly what is needed when we destroy() here destroy() is used as part of the process of shutting down a sessionfactory thus these removals should not be propogated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the 'from element' that represents the elements of the collection.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first allow the actual type to control the return value. (the actual underlying sqltype could actually be different)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for expected parameter type injection we expect that the lhs represents some form of property ref and that the children of the in-list represent one-or-more params.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the table fromelement and the property name to get the array of column names.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the difficulty here is exactly what do we update in order to force the version to be incremented in the db
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"cfg.setproperty(""hibernate.show_sql"" ""true"")"

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do this work only at the very highest level of the load do not let this method be called recursively
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the property is a component
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we cannot batch joined inserts *especially* not if it is an identity insert nor can we batch statements where the expectation is based on an output param
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	full joins are not supported.. yet!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check if the managed object is the parent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	refresh does not cascade to uninitialized collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	unwrap the object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	postdelete after actually deleting a row record the fact that the instance no longer exists on the database (needed for identity-column key generation) and remove it from the session cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	break the outer loop !!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this will add the new from element to the origin.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"actually the semantics of the next three are really ""bag"" note that unlike objects collection insertions updates deletions are not really remembered between flushes. we just re-use the same lists for convenience."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is not strictly true. we actually just need to make sure that it is ordered by root-entity pk and that that order-by comes before any non-root-entity ordering
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	configurable implementation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	origin.adddestination( destination ) this was the because of hhh-242 origin.settype( from_fragment ) set the parent node type so that the ast is properly formed. the destination node will have all the from text. the parent node is a collection join too (voodoo - see joinprocessor)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	build the dynamic-map tuplizer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to use the identifier type of the collection owner since the incoming is value is actually the owner's id. using the collection's key type causes problems with property-ref keys
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create the join element under the from element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	allow the collectionsnapshot to be serialized
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"note this simply constructs a ""raw"" sql_token representing the where fragment and injects this into the tree. this ""works"" however it is probably not the best long-term solution. at some point we probably want to apply an additional grammar to properly tokenize this where fragment into constituent parts focused on the operators embedded within the fragment."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we will need to remove ye olde entries
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	woops we got an instance of another class hierarchy branch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"even on inverse=""true"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle any filters applied to this collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	actually this last test is probably unnecessary since beforecompletion() does not get called during rollback
