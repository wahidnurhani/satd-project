DEFECT	important receive the block argument before the opt and splat args this is so that the *arg can be encoded as 'rest of the array'. this will not work if the block argument has not been received yet!
DEFECT	bug 997560 (fdietz) cc should be in cc instead of to tolist.addall(arrays.aslist(rfcheader.getcc()))
DEFECT	* * fixme * * @author fdietz no locking of folders currently implemented! * * @author frd
DEFECT	fixme if we terminate immediately this appears to break while in method arguments we need to push a nil for the cases where we will never enter the body
DEFECT	fixme mri has special case for constants here
DEFECT	fixme cannot use static would interfere with other runtimes in the same jvm
DEFECT	zero args with block fixme omit args index subtract one from normal block index
DEFECT	fixme add at_exit and finalizers to exit then make exit_bang not call those.
DEFECT	todo old version did not require hashmap lookup keys[collectionowner].getidentifier()
DEFECT	could happen for custom criteria impls. not likely but for long term solution see hhh-3514
DEFECT	todo figure out how this should be set. / this was the reason for failures regarding index_op and subclass joins on theta-join dialects not sure what behaviour we were trying to emulate ) joinsequence = joinsequence.getfrompart() emulate the old addfromonly behavior.
DEFECT	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know the operand node type where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DEFECT	2 aug 2003 os/2 java has a broken getcanonicalpath()
DEFECT	xxx action bar might not be 'temp'
DEFECT	only works for jedit plugins
DEFECT	{{{ set the buffer's path caveat will not work if save() called with a relative path. but i do not think anyone calls it like that anyway.
DEFECT	todo i18n gef needs to pass us back the description of what is being done.
DEFECT	* * rank the nodes depending on their level (position in hierarchy) and set * their weight to achieve a proper node-sequence for the layout. rows * exceeding the maximum row width are split if standalone nodes are * available. * * weight the other nodes to determine their columns. * * todo weighting does not appear to be working as intended because multiple * groups of children/specializations get intermixed in name order rather * than being grouped by their parent/generalization. - tfm - 20070314
DEFECT	todo this does not work - no event arrives.
DEFECT	todo this looks backwards. left over from issue 2034?
DEFECT	fixme factor with just append all the parameter values and use that as the post body
DEFECT	fixme due to startengine being commented engine will always be null private standardjmeterengine engine
DEFECT	installcolorsandfont needs to be run twice. background and foreground colors only work if run after the super call but font only works if run before the super call. may be a bug in jdk 1.4
DEFECT	* todo when 1.4 is the earliest version supported include * the following line here * scrollpane.setwheelscrollingenabled(true) * the scroll-wheel function is important for ease of use but the * setwheelscrollingenabled function is not available in java 1.3.
DEFECT	todo not yet working for uml2
DEFECT	* * a critic to detect when a classifier has to many operations). * * todo exclude getter and setter operations from count
DEFECT	* * todo the code implementing this method is from 2003 (see issue 2171) - * mechanically integrated by tfmorris in may 2007. needs to be * reviewed/updated. * * @author deckiendiyayan politechnic of bandung. computer departement * method for changing text of message * @param newowner * @param parameter
DEFECT	todo why do we clone the return value? this is the only reference to it (right?) so we should not need a separate copy.
DEFECT	do not need this because we should never ever be selecting no columns in an insert select and because it causes a bug on db2
DEFECT	fixme boundary condition at end of image for non-integral multiples of buffer_height
DEFECT	dirty fix for issue 1758 (needs to be amended * when we start supporting parameters)
DEFECT	todo not in uml 2
DEFECT	else if the y coordinate is outside of the classifier role we fix the y in the max y of the classifier role. fixme we should increase the height of the classifier role do not???
DEFECT	pattern now holds ** while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that.
DEFECT	the generated classes must not be added in the generic jar! is that buggy on old jonas (2.4) ??
DESIGN	todo unused?

DESIGN	todo do we need to worry about umlclass umlpackage etc?
DESIGN	todo this first loop just to count the items appears redundant to me - tfm 20070630
DESIGN	* * this class represents a pool of swimlanes for activity diagrams. this is * exists only to act as the gef style encloser. other nodes in the same * must be placed entirely within or outside the boundaries of this fig * but cannot intersect with the boundary. * todo there is no actual model element being represented here so we are * inheriting a lot of behaviour from fignodemodelelement that we do not want. * we require to split fignodemodelelement to separate the code that requires * a model element owner. see issue * remark mvw why not give it an owner instead? the activitygraph * is the obvious candidate or maybe the top state. * * @author mkl
DESIGN	todo move to different class?
DESIGN	todo should not be creating a new instance here. we should hold the delete action in some central place.
DESIGN	todo move to diagram subsystem?
DESIGN	* * todo this does not need a full profilereference since it uses the * reader handed in the constructor. it does not make much sense to make * its callers init the path to some name which it does not need * * @author luis sergio oliveira (euluis)
DESIGN	* * settings dialog tab panel for layout options. * * todo this class contains a lot of references to org.argouml.uml.ui. * it would probably be better to move it there. * * todo this class breaks too many dependency limitations. * and it is not used anywhere. so i (mvw) disabled its functionality. * * @author linus tolke
DESIGN	todo all this profile loading/handling needs to move someplace in model subsystem probably
DESIGN	todo this seems like a brute force workaround (and a very indirect one at that). it appears to be needed though until we fix the problem properly. - tfm 20070904

DESIGN	* * @return the set of offenders * * todo the return value needs to be more strongly typed. - tfm - 20070630
DESIGN	todo this creates a dependency on the critics subsystem. instead that subsystem should register its desired menus and actions.
DESIGN	todo what are these magic numbers?
DESIGN	todo this probably belongs with the diagram subsystem
DESIGN	the following is specifically for realizations todo correction in gef it should use interfacerealization not abstraction

DESIGN	todo remove listeners for add/remove events
DESIGN	todo will not our use of pathcomparator take care of uniqueness?
DESIGN	this is needed for a commentedge todo why does not commentedge implement iitemuid and be handled with the mechanism above.
DESIGN	todo do we care?
DESIGN	* * changes the font for all figs contained in the given figgroup. * * todo in fact there is a design error in this method * e.g. for a class if the name is italic since the class is abstract * then the classes features should be in plain font. * this problem can be fixed by implementing * the updatefont() method in all subclasses. * * @param fg the figgroup to change the font of.
DESIGN	todo performance. consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear at this point instead.
DESIGN	todo must we calculate the whole list?
DESIGN	todo how to merge multiple inheritance? necessary? this currently copies the common ancestors multiple times
DESIGN	"todo this uses a ""last one wins"" algorithm for registration we should warn if a factory is being overwritten."

DESIGN	todo mvw why is this not done in gef?
DESIGN	todo 21/12/2008 dthompson mouseclicked(me) above consumes the mouse event internally so i suspect that this line might not be necessary.
DESIGN	* * sets the language of an expression. * * todo this operation is fooling the user * in thinking that the body of the object is changed. * instead a new object is created. * there is no other way a mexpression can not be altered * once created! * so this operation returns a newly created object instead. * * @param handle the expression. * @param language the new language. * @return the newly created object.
DESIGN	* * builds a compositestate as top for some statemachine. * todo confusing name this method should better * be named buildtopstateonstatemachine. * * @param statemachine the given statemachine * @return mcompositestate the newly build top state * @see buildcompositestate(object)
DESIGN	* * builds an interface with a given name. * * @param name is the given name. * @return interface * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	* * return the source of a relation or link. the source of a relation is * defined as the modelelement that propagates this relation. if * there are more then 1 sources only the first is returned. if * there is no source null is returned. examples of sources * include classifiers that are types to associationends usecases * that are bases to extend and include relations and so on. a * source is always the start from the arrow in the fig the * destination the end. * * todo move this method to a generic modelhelper * * @param relationship is the relation * @return object

DESIGN	todo - how to handle thread stopped here
DESIGN	todo is sync really needed?
DESIGN	* fix bug -d arg1=arg2 was causing parse error however * --define arg1=arg2 is ok this seems to be because the parser * skips the terminator for the long options but was not doing * so for the short options.
DESIGN	* wrapper to convert a junit4 class into a testcase * * todo - work out how to convert junit4 assertions so they are treated as failures rather than errors
DESIGN	hack to allow entire url to be provided in host field
DESIGN	todo fetch list of languages from a file? n.b. changes to language list need to be reflected in resources/packagetest.java
DESIGN	how many classes can we assign from? todo there must be a nicer way
DESIGN	notused private string chosenfile
DESIGN	todo is this correct? if this is not the first file we cannot write its header now for simplicity we always save it even if there is only one file
DESIGN	todo should we allow mimetype only?
DESIGN	* jmetertreenode and testbeangui are special gui classes and * are not intended to be added to menus * * todo find a better way of checking this
DESIGN	todo - not sure this is the best method
DESIGN	* mask values for test_type todo remove either match or contains - they * are mutually exckusive

DESIGN	can be null (not sure why)
DESIGN	not used protected double[][] data = null
DESIGN	todo - use or remove
DESIGN	* the following variables are set by standardjmeterengine. * this is done before start() is called so the values will be published to the thread safely * todo - consider passing them to the constructor so that they can be made final * (to avoid adding lots of parameters perhaps have a parameter wrapper object.
DESIGN	is it an exception wrapped in a javascriptexception?
DESIGN	todo should level be more than debug ?
DESIGN	todo i believe the following code (to the end of the method) is obsolete since namepanel no longer seems to be the gui for any component
DESIGN	does not appear to be used (yet)
DESIGN	todo - move to jorphanutils?
DESIGN	todo this might really even be moved into the cfg package and used as the basis for all things which are configurable.
DESIGN	* create an action that will evict collection and entity regions based on queryspaces (table names). * todo cache the autodetected information and pass it in instead. *
DESIGN	entity name will not be available for non-pojo entities todo cache the entity name somewhere so that it is available to this exception
DESIGN	multiple rows - not good
DESIGN	todo hard coded -. jdbc/odbc bridge jdk1.4 brings back -9 for nvarchar columns in ms sql server tables.
DESIGN	todo is this a valid operation on a timestamps cache?
DESIGN	todo should we additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cannot handle whitespaces before a { in a sp
DESIGN	put a placeholder in entries so we do not recurse back and try to save() the same object again. question should this be done before onsave() is called? likewise should it be done before onupdate()?
DESIGN	hsql has no blob/clob support . but just put these here for now!
DESIGN	todo need to make the majority of this functionality into a top-level support class for custom impl support
DESIGN	todo refactor to .sql package
DESIGN	todo should orphans really be deleted during lock???
DESIGN	* * todo move all code other than for window creation up to aliaswindowmanager * factory to handle creation of maintenance sheets for sql alias objects. * * @author colin bell
DESIGN	this info is merely a placeholder in the tree that we can use to get index name and parent name more easily. we probably should create a indexcolumninfo that has this extra info in it.

DESIGN	todo should this just call super()?
DESIGN	todo hard coded -. jdbc/odbc bridge jdk1.4 brings back -9 for nvarchar columns in ms sql server tables. -8 is rowid in oracle.
DESIGN	todo make parameter implement sqlitem interface which has a getstring method which can also be implemented by sqlstring or sqlfragment or some such. we can then eliminate the use of instanceof below and clean up the code a bit by making itemsinsql look like arraylist itemsinsql = new arraylist()
DESIGN	we are displaying a new dataset so if there was a cell editor in operation tell it to cancel. ???? how does this impact popup display?
DESIGN	silently ignore what could we do anyway?
DESIGN	* todo find out why * kludge for some reason i am not able to get the sheet to * size correctly. it always displays with a size that causes * the sub-panels to have their scrollbars showing. add a bit * of an increase in the size of the panel so the scrollbars * are not displayed.
DESIGN	todo this will not work when the column has values with quotes in them. use preparedstatements instead. hmmm instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a) uses the sequence for the pkid b) selects distinct values that would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem
DESIGN	discovered that the loginame field can be null - in that case how to know we have the correct view?
DESIGN	this is a bit hard coded but if we use _scale here some number displays go crazy.
DESIGN	the following ugly conversion from text to byte is necessary because the byte class is inconsistant. when asked to output as hex it does so as an unsigned byte but when asked to read back the same thing using the hex radix it insists that the input must be signed. to get around this we up-size the conversion to integer then truncate that to a byte and finally convert the byte to a byte. yech.
DESIGN	unused but must return something so while we are at it
DESIGN	todo could change this to itemfillpaint(). for backwards compatibility it might require a usefillpaint flag.
DESIGN	to do these annotations only work with xyplot see if it is possible to make contourplot a subclass of xyplot (dg)
DESIGN	fixme perhaps we should clone the data list
DESIGN	todo (@author fdietz) i18n
DESIGN	fixme add setseriesitemurlgenerator(int categoryurlgenerator boolean)?
DESIGN	all attributes are immutable so we can just return the super.clone() fixme in fact the generator itself is immutable so cloning is not necessary
DESIGN	eatm demand create metadata needs to depend on processing mode
DESIGN	this runs the operation and shows progress. (it appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread.)
DESIGN	only file-scheme uris will be re-encoded. if a uri was decoded in the workaround above and platform.resolve() did not return a file-scheme uri then this will return an decoded uri.
DESIGN	do nothing for now and avoid propagating the exception. how should builders handle cancel?
DESIGN	todo would it be better to do a refresh from db?
DESIGN	todo deprecate (since getpluginclass() is no longer called)
DESIGN	assume that it is an attribute for now. it will/could become a reference if the type resolves to an eclass.
DESIGN	brand new collection todo or an array!! we cannot lock objects with arrays now??
DESIGN	real stupid recreation of whole list model -> replace with id-based listmodel update
DESIGN	todo fix layout to look good even if there is not enough information provided
DESIGN	todo absolutely no usages of this constructor form can it go away?
DESIGN	i know it is bad to create object. better idea?
DESIGN	todo this needs to move into the renderer state
DESIGN	todo (@author waffel) encrypt and sign dosnt work. the message is always only encrypted. we need a function that knows here is an encrypted and signed message. thus first encyrpt and then verifysign the message if this message is signed/encrypted we have to use gnupg to extract the decrypted bodypart - multipart/encrypted - multipart/signed
DESIGN	wait if there is an active transaction todo @author hubms retrycount!
DESIGN	fixme should we align the menu to the left instead? menu.show(b b.getwidth() - menu.getwidth() b.getheight())
DESIGN	what to do here? we could start a new server

DESIGN	this should be before dockables are initialized
DESIGN	check for field on object note could eliminate throwing the exception somehow
DESIGN	stupid caret will automatically be incremented
DESIGN	scripting classes currently requires accessibility this can be eliminated with a bit more work.
DESIGN	copy and paste from bsh/classpath/classmanagerimpl.java
DESIGN	todo this is a bit of copy/paste from indexedcollection.createprimarykey()
DESIGN	does this dialect support for update of allowing particular rows to be locked?
DESIGN	todo this was added to support initializing an entity's entityentry snapshot during reattach this should be refactored to instead expose a method to assemble a entityentry based on this state for return.
DESIGN	todo improve this hack!
DESIGN	use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility
DESIGN	todo copy/paste from recreate()
DESIGN	todo bad implementation cos it depends upon ordering of mapping doc fixing this requires that collection/persistentclass gain access to the mappings reference from configuration (or the filterdefinitions map directly) sometime during configuration.buildsessionfactory (after all the types/filter-defs are known and before building persisters).
DESIGN	allow getthis() to work through blocknamespace to the method namespace xxx re-eval this do we need it?
DESIGN	hack done to fix bringing the window to the front. at least on windows frame.tofront() does not cut it. remove the iswindows check if it is broken under other oses too.
DESIGN	they never taught you this in undergrad computer science
DESIGN	note that the way they are sorted the values of index[i++] always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list. eatm todo we could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result.
DESIGN	interval operator {x} | {x} | {xy} (re_intervals && re_no_bk_braces) \{x\} | \{x\} | \{xy\} (re_intervals && !re_no_bk_braces) open question what is proper interpretation of '{' at start of string?
DESIGN	this does not look pretty and mode line should * probably be split up into seperate * components/strings
DESIGN	ugly workaround
DESIGN	next version remove this
DESIGN	workaround for jdk bug 4071281 where system.in.available() returns too large a value. this bug has been fixed in jdk 1.2.

DESIGN	xxx clean up this conditional
DESIGN	"this is a sloppy hack to fix bug ""[ 677902 ] hitting return after collapsed fold"" the idea is that if we extend the range then the problem described in the bug happends so if the insert is at the very end of the range we do not extend it instead we push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly we also have to mess with screen line counts."
DESIGN	todo why do we need this as well as control? why is it instantiated when its not always needed.
DESIGN	"* * an opaqueexpression can have n body n language * * when display to user we only show one body. a "" "" button is enabled for * edit other. * * todo can we by import xmi have 0 language/body ? * * @author laurent braud"

DESIGN	* @see javax.swing.event.documentlistenerchangedupdate(javax.swing.event. * documentevent) todo are the 3 methods uses ?
DESIGN	todo this should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing everything and adding it again. - tfm
DESIGN	check that the two elements are not already linked the opposite way todo this is a part implementation of well-formedness rule uml1.4.2 - 4.5.3.20 [3] circular inheritance is not allowed. not self.allparents->includes(self)
DESIGN	todo we need to rethrow this as some other exception type but that is too much change for the moment.
DESIGN	fixme big fat hack here because scope names are expected to be interned strings by the parser
DESIGN	fixme this really ought to be in clinit but it does not matter much
DESIGN	we are not setting the provider or anything but it seems that bouncycastle does some internal things in its provider's constructor which require it to be executed in a secure context. ideally this hack should be removed. see jruby-3919 and this bc bug
DESIGN	fixme we should be getting this from the runtime rather than assume none? return runtime.getencodingservice().getencoding(runtime.getdefaultexternalencoding())
DESIGN	todo better error handling
DESIGN	sss fixme i added this in. is this correct?
DESIGN	objectto_a is obsolete. we match ruby's hack until to_a goes away. then we can remove this hack too.
DESIGN	* * builds a method with a given name. * * @param name is the given name * @return method * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo this needs to be managed on a per-project or per-model/extent basis
DESIGN	todo this probably cannot be implemented in a way that will make the uml 1.4 ui happy. needs to be generalized to uml 2 semantics.
DESIGN	todo move the magic number 4 to a descriptive constant
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml binding. * * @return an initialized uml binding instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml datatype. * * @return an initialized uml datatype instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo changed in uml 2.x to special type of property?
DESIGN	todo this should call the single namespace form getstereotype(it2.next() stereo)
DESIGN	todo check whether this is really needed. i think it is left over from an incomplete understanding of the magicdraw composition error problem - tfm
DESIGN	todo what other non-modelelement types do we need to handle here?
DESIGN	todo this does not belong in the implementation specific piece - tfm
DESIGN	todo we can choose between something which matches uml 1.4 in name or something that matches in functionality. we have chosen functionality for now but this will create a name conflict during the migration process. - tfm
DESIGN	todo can we get this info from uml2 plugin? perhaps collect all references in the metamodel filter for those which represent containments and find the types on either end - tfm
DESIGN	a cloned method now belongs to a new class. set it. todo make dynamicmethod immutable
DESIGN	fixme total hack to get flash in rails marshalling/unmarshalling in session ok we need to totally change marshalling to work with overridden core classes.
DESIGN	reset value map if this instruction is the start/end of a basic block right now calls are considered hard boundaries for optimization and information cannot be propagated across them! sss fixme rather than treat all calls with a broad brush what we need is to capture different attributes about a call - uses closures - known call target - can modify scope - etc. this information is probably already present in the ast inspector
DESIGN	fixme wtf is this? why would these use the class?
DESIGN	todo get rid of this (lax returns 0.0 strict will throw)
DESIGN	* todo this version is better than the hackish previous one. windows * behavior needs to be defined though. i suppose this version * could be improved more too. * todo /etc/passwd is also inadequate for macosx since it does not * use /etc/passwd for regular user accounts
DESIGN	todo what about n arg?
DESIGN	the class is now way to complex!
DESIGN	todo figure out a better way to get the from elements in a proper tree structure. if this is not the destination of a many-to-many add it as a child of the origin.
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of here create an ast for the join expressions. use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression.
DESIGN	must be done here because of side-effect! yuck
DESIGN	todo throw exception? maybe warn if not the same?
DESIGN	would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff. would need to change the way the max-row stuff is handled (i.e. behind an interface) so that i could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
DESIGN	we should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way.
DESIGN	index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end?
DESIGN	exit monitor before making call fixme this not being in a finally is a little worrisome
DESIGN	up to ten stuff into tmp locals load in reverse order and assign fixme there is probably a slightly smarter way but is it important?
DESIGN	todo this is really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone require's something. we should try to make loadpath a special array object.
DESIGN	actual type does not exactly match method return type re-get converter fixme when the only autoconversions are primitives this will not be needed
DESIGN	fixme set up a callconfiguration for this
DESIGN	* * fixme this version is faster than the previous but both suffer from a * crucial flaw it is impossible to create an objectspace with an iterator * that does not either a. hold on to objects that might otherwise be collected * or b. have no way to guarantee that a call to hasnext() will be correct or * that a subsequent call to next() will produce an object. for our purposes * for now this may be acceptable.
DESIGN	todo we should be able to optimize this quite a bit post-1.0. javaclass already has all the methods organized by method name the next version (supporting protected methods/fields) will have them organized even further. so collectmethods here can just lookup the overridden methods in the javaclass map should be much faster.
DESIGN	fixme weakref.rb also does caller(2) here for the backtrace
DESIGN	fixme get rid of laziness and handle restricted access elsewhere
DESIGN	fixme i think we need these pushed somewhere?
DESIGN	todo this probably is not the best hack but it works until we can have different root frame setup for 1.9 easily.
DESIGN	fixme can get optimized for ieqlnode
DESIGN	* @todo using taskname here is brittle as a user could override it. * this should probably be modified to use the classname instead.
DESIGN	mac os 9 and previous todo i have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
DESIGN	* fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or * do not know how to handle it (there is no easy way to * know what idl mode would generate. * * this is supposed to make ant always recompile the * class as a file of that name should not exist.
DESIGN	xxx move to project ( so it is shared by all helpers )
DESIGN	not sure what could be the need of this
DESIGN	xxx we should use jcvs ( instead of command line execution so that we do not rely on having native cvs stuff around (sm)
DESIGN	* xxx i really do not like this - the xml processor is still * too 'involved' in the processing. a better solution (I am going to) * would be to create ue for project and target too and * then process the tree and have project/target deal with * its attributes ( similar with description ). * * if we eventually switch to ( or add support for ) dom * things will work smoothly - ue can be avoided almost completely * ( it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility )
DESIGN	this is the new better way - use classespath instead of sourcespath. the code is currently the same - you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files.
DESIGN	hammer end inline maingtu
DOCUMENTATION	todo document the reason for this
DOCUMENTATION	todo add javadocs
DOCUMENTATION	todo check conformancy to specification
DOCUMENTATION	todo the quickguide also mentions * -open open given file on startup * -print print given file on startup (and exit) * why are these gone?
DOCUMENTATION	* * the event to fire. * * todo investigate! is the purpose really to let the next call to * {@link firepropertychanged(string object object)} fire the old * event again if the previous invocation resulted in an exception? * if so please document why. if not fix it.
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme somewhere here we need to record information the type of this operand as string
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme traverse up the scope hierarchy to find the constant as long as the parent is a static scope
IMPLEMENTATION	todo removed from uml 2.x
IMPLEMENTATION	apparently this method is never called.
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme pass block down?
IMPLEMENTATION	sss fixme to be done
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we have anything to add here?
IMPLEMENTATION	* called after the diagram font gets changed. * * todo do we need to do anything here? * * @see java.beans.propertychangelistenerpropertychange(java.beans.propertychangeevent)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo beautify the 2nd part of this string
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme should we make this work with platform's locale or continue hardcoding us?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo port exact behavior from mri and move most locking logic into channeldescriptor todo for all lock_nb cases return false if they would block
IMPLEMENTATION	todo 3 times calculate the same value below
IMPLEMENTATION	todo to enable models and subsystems change this flag work started by markus i believe where does this stand? - bob.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement additional operations in 4.5.3.5
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this!
IMPLEMENTATION	* perform re-routing if src/dest nodes have changed. * * this method needs to be 'armed' by a previous mousedragged() * to avoid the situation where the user just clicks on the node * then clicks on some unrelated fig without moving the edge * * todo improve the fig finding algorithm to find the top most fig * in the layer. will be useful for nested states in a statechart. * * @see java.awt.event.mouselistenermousereleased(java.awt.event.mouseevent)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo gone in uml 2.1
IMPLEMENTATION	* * the uml 1.4 model elements to test. * * todo this needs to be updated with a version for uml 2.x.
IMPLEMENTATION	there is more to be handled which still need to be implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	* * eclipse uml2 implementation of xmiwriter. * * todo we need facilities for writing and reading stable ids to/from either * xmi.id or xmi.uuid. * * @author tom morris
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this will need to change when we support multiple user models.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check safe taint on incoming string
IMPLEMENTATION	todo count/report unresolved references
IMPLEMENTATION	* * identifier for addonly changeability. * todo note this should not be in uml2 version
IMPLEMENTATION	if not already defined we add a 'new' that guesses at which signature to use todo just adding first one right now add in signature-guessing logic
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why do i need to do this?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo something about pipe buffer length here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this could be made more efficient by working with iterators directly and creating a composite iterator made up of all the various sub iterators.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo eventually put this back in once we think all is fixed object otheralias = columnsunique.put(qualifiedcolumn columnalias)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo unnecessary for databases with ansi-style joins
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache this sql
IMPLEMENTATION	* * flag to indicate we are creating a new current project. * todo this is not a thread-safe way of doing mutual exclusion.
IMPLEMENTATION	"* the displayname variable stores the value of the ""display-name"" element * from the standard ejb descriptor. as a future enhancement to this task * we may determine the name of the ejb jar file using this display-name * but this has not be implemented yet."
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check there is no actual definition elemnents when a ref is defined
IMPLEMENTATION	todo return new lock(ts)
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo if the use checks ""export entire table"" and does not select all then the selected indices are not set and this check does not properly detect missing data. if export entire table is selected we need to set the selected indexes below correctly."
IMPLEMENTATION	todo plugin supports only the main session window
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this better
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mappings.getlogicaltablename(ownertable)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo review - priority of public id vs system id has been reversed from original implementation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tell the user that the selected destination schema is the same as the source schema. monitor.showmessagedialog( )
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tentative implementation. do we want something that updates the list of open projects or just simple open and close events? -tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	xxx hypotheses no qualifiers (i do not know)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement validation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add recent patterns
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add and delete not currently supported $non-nls-1$
IMPLEMENTATION	"* * parse the xml declaration. * * [25] xmldecl = '<?xml' versioninfo encodingdecl? sddecl? s? '?>' * [26] versioninfo = s 'version' eq ('""1.0""' | ""'1.0'"") * [33] sddecl = s 'standalone' eq ""'"" ('yes' | 'no') ""'"" * | s 'standalone' eq '""' (""yes"" | ""no"") '""' * [78] encodingdecl = s 'encoding' eq qencoding * * ([80] to [82] are also significant.) * (the <?xml and whitespace have already been read.) * todo validate value of standalone. * @see parsetextdecl * @see checkencoding"
IMPLEMENTATION	it is chunked transfer encoding which we do not really support yet. so we just read without blocking because we do not know when to stop reading so we cannot block todo propery implement support for chunked transfer i.e. to know when we have read the whole request and therefore allow the reading to block
IMPLEMENTATION	todo processing instructions are not sent to recordvalues
IMPLEMENTATION	* * the constructor. * todo why does this method not handle all settings?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo translation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add dialog to inform user that the smtp server does not support authentication
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle situation when astjnode is removed (compilationunit is null)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we put the static block within the init()?
TEST	todo improve this test $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-2$ missing variable name
TEST	?w | boolean | true if file1 exists and is writable by the real uid/gid fixme need to implement an writable_real_p in filetest
TEST	* * all events going to the explorer must pass through here first! * * most will come from the uml model via the eventadapter interface. * * todo in some cases (test cases) this object is created without setting * the treemodel. i (linus) will add tests for this now. it would be better * if this is created only when the explorer is created. * * todo the explorertreenode also listens to some events * (from diagrams) so it does not follow the rule above. * * @since 0.15.2 created on 16 september 2003 2313 * @author alexb
TEST	is getname() ok? test with 1.1
TEST	@todo this is duplicating testresult information. only the time is not part of the result. so we would better derive a new class from testresult and deal with it. (sb)
TEST	modelelement is abstract so no create tests todo add any other relevant tests
TEST	if the method is extending something then we have to test if the handler is initialized
TEST	the application should have checked for availability at startup. for tests we would expect unix developers to be correctly configured. replace with an assert when we are jre1.4+
