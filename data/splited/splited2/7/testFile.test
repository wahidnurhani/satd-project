DEFECT	"todo rewriter and compiler assume case when empty expression. in mri this is just a when. assert casenode != null ""casenode is not null"""
DEFECT	todo proper sign
DEFECT	todo not serialized yet
DEFECT	fixme this is not correct
DEFECT	todo full-precision divmod is 1000x slower than mri!
DEFECT	fixme errno descriptions from constantine on windows are not useful at the moment.
DEFECT	fixme we are assuming that original string will be raw bytes. if -ku is provided this will not be true but that is ok for now. deal with that when someone needs it.
DEFECT	fixme not correct exception
DEFECT	todo currently we do not know a sessionfactory reference when building the tuplizer this is a bug (embedded-xml=false on component) todo fix this after hhh-1907 is complete
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk and entity name fix this!
DEFECT	todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
DEFECT	todo this call will not work for anything other than pojos!
DEFECT	original note jdk under win is throwing these to warn about lower case / upper case possible mismatch. e.g. bsh.console bsh.console update prior to 1.3 we were squeltching noclassdeffounderrors which was very annoying. i cannot reproduce the original problem and this was never a valid solution. if there are legacy vms that have problems we can include a more specific test for them here.
DEFECT	warning null callstack here. do not think we need a stack trace to indicate how we sourced the method.
DEFECT	this is only needed (afaict) for processing results from the query cache however this cannot possibly work in the case of discovered types
DEFECT	this is not good need a way to update eval without re-installing so that we can re-eval params etc. when classloader changes look into this
DEFECT	fixme this is wrong
DEFECT	todo correctly implement next function * in the model subsystem for * issue 1942
DEFECT	todo this works for 90 degree angles but is suboptimal for other angles. it should reflect the angle rather than just using a negative offset along the same vector
DEFECT	todo something might go wrong during processing. we do not really want to create the model element until the user releases the mouse in the place expected.
DEFECT	the following query produces a result that should be editable but it currently is not
DEFECT	todo display warning dialog as this can take some time
DEFECT	* * utility function to localize the given string with help text and show it * in the status bar of the argouml window. this function is used in favour * of the inline call to enable later improvements e.g. it would be * possible to show a help-balloon. * * todo work this out. one matter to possibly improve show multiple lines. * * @param s the given string to be localized and shown
DEFECT	if we are connecting to a database then this is fine. however when using mockobjects this is problematic since there are many unimplemented methods in the mockobjects implementation that are required by this.
DEFECT	todo - removes the nodes from the checkdirty map - should it be done later in case some cannot be removed?
DEFECT	todo this should probably only update the project when the user presses return or focus is lost
DEFECT	status as of november 2008 - figs created property panels exist more work required on explorer and assumptions about models not being nested - tfm
DEFECT	todo full-precision remainder is 1000x slower than mri!
DEFECT	todo - should save and restore the last positions of the toolbars
DEFECT	todo use model.getmodelmanagementhelper().getpathlist(modelelement) todo this will fail with nested models
DEFECT	todo algorithm is n^2 in number of nodes
DEFECT	many many of these events .. this slows things down
DEFECT	todo not implemented by euml
DEFECT	check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an outofmemoryerror or it fails when there is a native library to load several times. this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases.
DEFECT	note at least my local sql server 2005 express shows this not working
DESIGN	* * searches for a type/classifier with name s. if the type is not found a * new type is created and added to the current namespace. * * todo move to model subsystem - tfm 20070307 * * @param s * the name of the type/classifier to be found * @return classifier

DESIGN	could this be some other type of internal error that we want to handle differently? do not think so. - tfm
DESIGN	todo silently ignore instead? return false
DESIGN	todo this could be a huge collection - find a more efficient way
DESIGN	load .xmi file before any pgml files fixme the following is loading the model before anything else. due to the zargo containing the profiles currently we have removed this hack in umlfilepersister and i think it should be removed from here also.
DESIGN	* * todo this needs work so that users can set the font * size through a gui preference window.
DESIGN	* * this fig is never placed on a diagram. it is only used by the call * renderer so that pick list items look like diagram figs. * todo this fig does not represent a model element and so it * should not extend fignodemodelelement. we should split * fignodemodelelement in two one for base functionality for all nodes * and one that is truly for model elements.
DESIGN	todo delete should be available on any combination of model elements and diagrams. todo should not be creating a new instance here. we should hold the delete action in some central place.
DESIGN	* todo work in progress here to allow multiple details panes with * different contents - bob tarling
DESIGN	* * the file persister for the uml model. * todo this is empty. what is its purpose? - tfm * @author bob tarling
DESIGN	todo this is an absurdly long method! break it up.
DESIGN	todo some parts of argouml have preliminary support for multiple * details panels but we currently only support * the default south (bottom) panel
DESIGN	todo optimize for root model case? - tfm
DESIGN	todo better if we wrap in a profileexception and throw that
DESIGN	todo consider inherited associations? todo self loops are double counted
DESIGN	todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory
DESIGN	todo would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly!
DESIGN	todo here is why we need to make bytecode provider global ( todo again fix this after hhh-1907 is complete
DESIGN	todo this is a little inefficient do not need to do a whole deep replaceelements() call
DESIGN	* * loads a project displaying a nice progressmonitor * * @param file the project to be opened * @param showui whether to show the gui or not * * todo this needs to be refactored to be gui independent - tfm
DESIGN	now get all classifiers imported from other packages todo this should probably happen automatically in getallmodelelementsofkind() - tfm
DESIGN	if is a classifier role it must return the sent messages. in other cases returns an empty list. todo must be the incoming messages or the sent ones?
DESIGN	our superclass no longer has this method so perhaps this whole thing should be removed? - tfm super.updatelisteners(newowner)
DESIGN	todo why is this inside a block? forgotten else branch?!? question by euluis @ 2009-08-16.
DESIGN	todo all super constrcutors should take a graphmodel
DESIGN	todo this method can be replaced by getclass().getsimplename() when argo drops support for java versions < 1.5
DESIGN	todo we would like these to not be filled but gef will not let us select them if we do that. setfilled(false)
DESIGN	needed?
DESIGN	* * reroutes the connection to the old node to be connected to * the new node. * * delegates to reroutexxx() for each of the 4 possible edges in * a class diagram association dependency generalization link. * todo this should probably be in superclass. many figs can be on * several diagram types. * * @param newnode this is the new node that one of the ends is dragged to. * @param oldnode this is the existing node that is already connected. * @param edge this is the edge that is being dragged/rerouted * @param issource tells us which end is being rerouted.
DESIGN	* * class to display graphics for n-ary association (association node) * i.e. the diamond. * * todo improve the location of the stereotypes! * * @author pepargouml@yahoo.es
DESIGN	todo this should be managed by the detailspane targetlistener - tfm remove the following line

DESIGN	todo projectbrowser does not need to mediate this conversation use an event listener in the todopane to communicate instead. - tfm
DESIGN	* * this class models the designer who is building a complex design in * some application domain and needs continuous feedback to aid in the * making of good design decisions. * * this area needs work especially as it is a * central idea of argo. * * currently (almost) everything is hardcoded. what can be configurable?? * * the todolist is dependent on this class * i.e. each designer has its todolist. * * each designer has his own agency * which is the only class that knows all the critics. * * this class listens to property changes from ? * * a designer can create todo items just like the critics. hence the designer * implements the poster interface. * * todo there is a strong dependency cycle between agency and designer. they * either need to be merged into a single class or partitioned differently * perhaps using an interface to break the cycle. the designer singleton gets * passed to almost every single part of the critic subsystem creating strong * coupling throughout. - tfm 20070620 * * @author jason robbins
DESIGN	andreas this is just temporary for the uml2 pre-alpha versions.
DESIGN	* * todo bob says - this is a really nasty horrible hack. * shadowfig should not extend fignodemodelelement. instead * we require a base class fignode with common behaviour of all * nodes in argouml. shadowfig should extend that and * fignodemodelelement should extend that same base class adding * common functionality for fignode that represent model element. * @see org.argouml.uml.diagram.ui.fignodemodelelementsetshadowsize(int)
DESIGN	todo the following is mdr specific. we need something generic to all model subsystems - tfm 20070716
DESIGN	* * todo this whole class needs to be updated to remove use of deprecated * methods and (hopefully) test multi-root and multi-project methods. * * @since nov 17 2002 * @author jaap.branderhorst@xs4all.nl
DESIGN	todo this is in the wrong place. it is not profile specific. it needs to be moved to main xmi reading code. - tfm 20060326
DESIGN	* * we are getting events we do not want. filter them out. * todo can we instruct the model event pump not to send these in the * first place? see defect 5095. * @param event the event
DESIGN	* * recursive method to get all subtypes. * * todo does this have a scalability problem?
DESIGN	todo some elements such as generalization are no longer named. for a transitional period we will return a string so debug can continue but the calling code should probably be fixed. - tfm 20070607 bob says - these are the comments that were in facadeeumlimpl.getname. same trick is needed here for now.
DESIGN	todo do we need this generalization is not a named element
DESIGN	todo what is this needed for? - tfm
DESIGN	* * when we change the type we need to create a new initial value. and * to display the panel * * todo if we select the same type that the current do nothing.
DESIGN	todo is this returning extended elements or base classes?
DESIGN	* * prevent underline events if underline does not change. * todo gef should manage this after gef 0.13.4 is included.
DESIGN	* * todo move this in figgroup (in gef). * * @param scb the suppresscalcbounds to set.
DESIGN	todo we really want this class to have package scope however the reflection
DESIGN	* * searches for a stereotype just like the given stereotype in all * given models (and their sub-namespaces). * the given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet * otherwise it will be returned itself! * * todo this function should not take a stereotype object as parameter * but a name and a baseclass. * todo currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass. * todo should it only search for stereotypes owned by the model object? * * @param models a collection of models * @param stereo is the given stereotype * @return stereotype
DESIGN	* * this tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when * importing. * if it is set then the critics could ignore those objects if they want. * * todo this is really belongs in a higher level utility class * that uses the facade's tagged value methods. also it needs to * be updated to use a uml 1.4 tagdefinition instead of a simple string.
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml permission. * * @return an initialized uml permission instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo find a way to avoid the cost of creating a string here -- probably a new patternmatcherinput working on a byte[] would do better.
DESIGN	todo - should this be done when the client is created? if so then the details need to be added as part of
DESIGN	does not appear to be used
DESIGN	todo not used by gui
DESIGN	todo should the engine be static?
DESIGN	todo field always true what for ?
DESIGN	not currently used
DESIGN	not used transient protected threadgroup threadgroup = null anyway was this supposed to be the class from java.lang or jmeter.threads?
DESIGN	keep the unexpanded path todo - allow directories to end with .jar by removing this check?
DESIGN	"showing large strings can be very costly so we will avoid doing so if the response data is larger than 200k. todo instead we could delay doing the result.settext call until the user chooses the ""response data"" tab. plus we could warn the user if this happens and revert the choice if he does not confirm he is ready to wait."
DESIGN	todo can this happen?
DESIGN	get the content length it tells us how much data to read todo maybe support chunked encoding then we cannot rely on content length
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ todo - probably wrong
DESIGN	todo only called by userparameterxmlparser.getxmlparameters which is a deprecated class
DESIGN	* not clear what can because this ? conflicting versions perhaps
DESIGN	todo make the running indicator its own class instead of a jbutton
DESIGN	* does the system support unc paths? if so may need to fix them up * later
DESIGN	put() has nowait semantics is this really appropriate? note that it needs to be async replication never local or sync
DESIGN	todo replace with proper exception
DESIGN	todo is this ever used?
DESIGN	a check just in case
DESIGN	todo temporary hack to avoid unnecessary bug reports for subclasses
DESIGN	* * custom trustmanager ignores all certificate errors * * todo implement conditional checking and logging * * (derived from authsslx509trustmanager in contrib directory)
DESIGN	* these must be set before reading/writing the xml. rather a hack but * saves changing all the method calls to include an extra variable. * * afaik the variables should only be accessed from one thread so no need to synchronize.
DESIGN	* todo consider removing this method and providing method wrappers instead. * this would allow the gui package to do any additional clearups if required * as has been done with cleartestplan()
DESIGN	settings readresolve sets these from the server/client values as appropriate todo would be nice to make these final not 100% sure volatile is needed as not changed after creation
DESIGN	* todo - convert to work more like upgrade.properties/nameupdater.java * * special processing is carried out for the header class the string * property testelement.name is converted to header.name for example * mozilla%2f4.0+%28compatible%3b+msie+5.5%3b+windows+98%29 * user-agent * becomes mozilla%2f4.0+%28compatible%3b+msie+5.5%3b+windows+98%29 * user-agent
DESIGN	todo never reached since gettypename() actually throws an exception!
DESIGN	note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass! was tounqotedaliasstrings( getidentifercolumnnames() ) before - now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	todo move to .sql package and refactor with similar things!
DESIGN	total hack! type other(1111) can be other types as well?
DESIGN	"when i tried using a length for longvarbinary that is the max length of the source records i get the following exception exception condition 239. data exception - string data right truncation. i tried bit varying(32767) with data that had max length of 16384. so it is back to maximum length hard-coded for now. registercolumntype(types.longvarbinary 2147000000 ""bit varying($l)"")"
DESIGN	todo these 2 should be handled with an iterator!!!
DESIGN	fixme get the persistentclass
DESIGN	it is possible that the tree-walking in outerjoinloader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property-ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known - this temporary solution assumes that the property-ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to (a reasonable guess) todo fix this add outerjoinloadable.getsubclasspropertytablename(string propertyname)
DESIGN	todo the order in which entities are saved may matter (e.g. a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entities can be saved keep retrying the batch of transient entities until either 1) there are no transient entities left in transientcopycache or 2) no transient entities were saved in the last batch for now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge
DESIGN	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DESIGN	todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then get the id from collection.getowner()
DESIGN	todo this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package add a criteriaimplementor interface
DESIGN	todo it would be really really nice to use this to also model components!
DESIGN	todo just noticed that mysql 5.0 supports a multi-bit bit column by using the getobject/setobject methods with a byte[]. so it would be valuable at some point to make this code a bit more dbms-specific
DESIGN	todo maybe instead of throwing an exception we could ask the user if they would like us to adjust their preference for them.
DESIGN	for some reason when the oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the _tabpnl's first tab ends up being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab. this causes the _tabs length to be 1 tab greater than the tabs that are actually in the _tabpnl. this throws off the selection such that the tab selected in the tab panel does not get rendered until the tab to the right of the selected tab is selected. this is a work-around for this problem until i can determine why the databaseobjectinfotab never makes it into the _tabpnl in the first place.
DESIGN	"work-around for bug which means we must use ""dbo"" for schema"
DESIGN	jason mow that multiple object trees exist storing the edit where by objectinfo within session will not work. it needs to be objectinfo within something else. private final map _editwherecolssheets = new hashmap()
DESIGN	?? split these 4 functions off into a subclass of basefavouriteaction
DESIGN	todo figure out why bind variables are not working
DESIGN	"todo maybe we should have a checkbox to allow the user to toggle default value on/off. some dbs (like db2) treat empty string """" as a different default value than null."
DESIGN	this is weird - if i do not set this the column header does not line up with the column contents.
DESIGN	todo bizarre that i could not find a valid sql to drop an index.
DESIGN	some dbs (like mckoi) make -1 the default for scale. apply the same hack as above.
DESIGN	??need to tell object to display itself in a panel.
DESIGN	hack to deal with firebird's rdb meta tables.
DESIGN	!! todo all code below here is duplicated in figbasenode. the reason is the gef defect - once we have taken a release of gef with that fix we can remove this code.
DESIGN	todo rotate the image when drawn with horizontal orientation?
DESIGN	do we need to update the crosshair values?
DESIGN	todo shift block over to right
DESIGN	todo (@author javaprog) better exception handling
DESIGN	hack to ensure the newly created awt fonts will be rendered with the same height as the swt one
DESIGN	todo urlencode?
DESIGN	todo handle class cast exception better.
DESIGN	motif kludge we would get something random instead of null.
DESIGN	todo hack that should be removed.
DESIGN	this is copied from itemprovideradapterfactory.
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context (maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set ) todo calling entryset on an identitymap is slow!!
DESIGN	todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry-s
DESIGN	dms what if eclipse is running but an invalid facade has been specified? we still should format code use encoding
DESIGN	todo perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved-value?
DESIGN	todo (@author tstich) do something
DESIGN	todo @author hubms bad if there is a icon it is tagged or not
DESIGN	this may be obsolete (not used anywhere)
DESIGN	fixme this attribute is not used - deprecate?
DESIGN	fixme this attribute is never used - deprecate?
DESIGN	/ a kludge to make everything work when no rows returned
DESIGN	todo ristretto should handle the logging of streams in another way.
DESIGN	todo externalize string $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	since columba is doing its own logging handlers we should not use handlers in the parent logger.
DESIGN	??? bad to have release hardocoded here. fix later right.
DESIGN	"* * command executes the search. * * in case new result results arrive it ensures that all interested * listeners are notified from inside the edt. * * fixme fdietz no locking of folders currently implemented! todo fdietz * create new command for every provider to introduce real ""parallel"" search * * @author fdietz"
DESIGN	todo before inserting find out if there is already a menu item * with the same action command. if so replace it otherwise insert new
DESIGN	todo remove these last two as batcher is no longer managing connections
DESIGN	note this class essentially just delegates most of its methods to its parent. the setvariable() indirection is very small. we could probably fold this functionality back into the base namespace as a special case. but this has changed a few times so I would like to leave this abstraction for now.
DESIGN	need to loosen this to any throwable do we need to handle that in interpreter somewhere? check first
DESIGN	does this dialect support the alter table syntax?
DESIGN	a little hack for reverse replace and find
DESIGN	is it necessary to register %exact since it can only appear in a where clause?
DESIGN	catch the mismatch and continue to try the next note this is innefficient should have an isassignablefrom() that does not throw
DESIGN	todo this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
DESIGN	"todo better to degrade to lazy=""false"" if uninstrumented"
DESIGN	this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call start
DESIGN	todo yuck!!!
DESIGN	get the right object from the list would it be easier to just call getentity() ??
DESIGN	hack/workaround as sqlquery impl depend on having a key.
DESIGN	ick!
DESIGN	this part sucks
DESIGN	this is such a bad way of doing it but oh well
DESIGN	* xxx hairy code that is basically just a functional(?) port of some * other code i barely understood
DESIGN	note this method and resolveexpectedjavafield should be rewritten to invert this logic so that no exceptions need to be caught unecessarily. this is just a temporary impl. @return the field or null if not found
DESIGN	note this should really just throw nosuchfieldexception need to change related signatures and code.
DESIGN	xxx magic number
DESIGN	note we need a singleton here so that things like 'this == this' work (and probably a good idea for speed). caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the declaringinterpreter could be different under some circumstances. (case a child interpreter running a source() / eval() command ). however the effect is just that the main interpreter that executes your script should be the one involved in call-backs from java. i do not know if there are corner cases where a child interpreter would be the first to use a this reference in a namespace or if that would even because any problems if it did we could do some experiments to find out and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter basis if we had weak references we might also look at skipping over child interpreters and going to the parent for the declaring interpreter so we would be sure to get the top interpreter.
DESIGN	this is a dirty hack and it relies on the fact that updates for parents are sent before updates for the changed nodes themselves (if this was not the case the browser would not be updated properly on delete etc). to avoid causing '> 1 request' errors do not reload directory if request already active
DESIGN	note this impor pattern is becoming common could factor it out into an importedobject vector class.
DESIGN	why both of these?
DESIGN	moved to guiutilities as it makes no sense being here.
DESIGN	retarded gtk look and feel!
DESIGN	note this class is messy. the method and field resolution need to be rewritten. various methods in here catch nosuchmethod or nosuchfield exceptions during their searches. these should be rewritten to avoid having to catch the exceptions. method lookups are now cached at a high level so they are less important however the logic is messy.
DESIGN	todo move magic number 10 to descriptive constant
DESIGN	* * todo is is really used ? * * @see javax.swing.jcomponentremovenotify()
DESIGN	todo we should really test the model instead for this but we have no api yet. can we just check if the collection to build the jlist control implements the list interface?
DESIGN	regular division with some default precision todo proper algorithm to set the precision
DESIGN	todo the type of the model element used in a type parameter (ie the formal) needs to match the actual parameter that it gets replaced with later. this code is going to restrict that to always being a parameter which does not seem right but i do not have time to debug it right now. - tfm - 20090608
DESIGN	end hack
DESIGN	* todo as currently implemented this expects a list of * multiplicityranges. is this an interface change from the nsuml * implementation? i suspect it used to accept a list of integers. - tfm * * @see org.argouml.model.datatypesfactorycreatemultiplicity(java.util.list)
DESIGN	todo not_allocatable_allocator is probably ok here. confirm. jruby-415
DESIGN	todo this should entry into error handling somewhere
DESIGN	todo make callcoerced work in block context then fix downto step and upto.
DESIGN	fixme obvious issue that not all platforms can display all attributes. ugly hacks. using generic posix library makes pushing inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful.
DESIGN	fixme we should really not be creating the dynamic scope for the root of the ast before parsing. this makes us end up needing to readjust this dynamic scope coming out of parse (and for local static scopes it will always happen because of $~ and $_). fixme because we end up adjusting this after-the-fact we cannot use any of the specific-size scopes.
DESIGN	fixme constdecl could be two seperate classes (or done differently since constnode and name never exist at the same time.
DESIGN	todo factor this chunk as in mri/yarv getaster
DESIGN	* * create a uml templateargument. * * @since uml 1.4 * @return an initialized templateargument instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	this should be moved to a ui action.
DESIGN	todo we do not want to do this once we have dropped uml1.3 map uml 1.4 names to uml 1.3 equivalents
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml elementresidence. * * @return an initialized uml elementresidence instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	convert to bounding box very screwy! gef sometimes uses center and sometimes upper left todo gef also positions text at the nominal baseline which is well inside the bounding box and gives the overall size incorrectly
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml abstraction. * * @return an initialized uml abstraction instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	* * create an enumerationliteral. * @return object new enumeration * @since uml 1.4 * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	"apply <> stereotype to make it a ""profile"" (our convention) (hack create that stereotype instead using the uml 1.4 profile)"
DESIGN	todo this can be simplified to just ((include) extend).setbase((usecase) base)
DESIGN	todo rationalize this with getmodelelementcontainer
DESIGN	* * this keeps track of the editing domain that is used to track all changes * to the model. * * todo this probably needs to be a set of editingdomain so that we can * manage an editingdomain per project.
DESIGN	todo in uml2.x event has no parameters. the event metaclass in uml1.x corresponds to the trigger metaclass in uml2.x (see uml superstructure page 456).
DESIGN	todo is this removed from uml2 ?
DESIGN	todo we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hql-sql grammar expects all those node types to be fromreferencenodes. one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclause/fromelement combo (as a child of the insertstatement) and move all this logic into the insertstatement. that is probably the easiest approach (read least amount of changes to the grammar and code) but just does not feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from-clauses
DESIGN	todo public only?
DESIGN	sss fixme should i have a reference to the ir_loop that is being retried?
DESIGN	sss fixme these should get normally compiled or initialized some other way sss fixme parent/super-type info is incorrect! these are just placeholders for now .. this needs to be updated with *real* class objects later!
DESIGN	fixme this probably belongs in a different package.
DESIGN	sss fixme where does this go? m.setlineposition(arraynode.getposition())
DESIGN	fixme this is probably not very efficient since it loads all methods for each call
DESIGN	real hacky used to count the nesting of parentheses

DESIGN	not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release
DESIGN	todo potentially look at optimizing these two arrays
DESIGN	for backward compatibility allow a set with no not-null element columns using all columns in the row locater sql todo create an implicit not null constraint on all cols?
DESIGN	todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package
DESIGN	"needed the ""clazz_"" check to work around union-subclasses todo is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim-column based inheritence?"
DESIGN	todo handle writing into original buffer better

DESIGN	from dup_setup rb_copy_generic_ivar from dup_setup here unlikely..
DESIGN	fixme this is pretty gross we should have a cleaner initialization that does not depend on package-visible fields and ideally is atomic probably using an immutable structure we replace all at once. lazy null when no groups defined
DESIGN	grrr arghh want to subclass sun.misc.floatingdecimal but cannot so we must do all this (the next 70 lines of code) which has already been done by floatingdecimal.
DESIGN	todo should next and return also catch here?
DESIGN	sss fixme can this return anything other than nil?
DESIGN	fixme if nativeexception is expected to be used from ruby code it should provide a real allocator to be used. otherwise class.new will fail as will marshalling. jruby-415
DESIGN	todo this can be a mess there are any better solution?
DESIGN	we assume that every output jikes does stands for an error/warning xxx is this correct?
DESIGN	todo there is a problem with the constructor for the rbc. you have to provide the rules in the constructors - no setters available.
DESIGN	junit 4 wraps solo tests this way. we can extract the original test name with a little hack.
DESIGN	cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility >(
DESIGN	-------------------- access to property tables -------------------- this is used to support ant call and similar tasks. it should be deprecated it is possible to use a better (more efficient) mechanism to preserve the context.
DESIGN	stolen from writemanifest
DESIGN	singleton for now it may change ( per/classloader )
DESIGN	* * this array really should not be here. * again for historical purposes it is. * * fixme this array should be in a private or package private * location since it could be modified by malicious code.
DESIGN	not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions.
DOCUMENTATION	* * **fixme** this function needs documentation * * constructor * * @param string * name * @param hashtable * attributes *
DOCUMENTATION	* * **fixme** this function needs documentation * * @param out * outputstream to print the data to *
DOCUMENTATION	* * returns all substates some composite state contains. * * todo {@link getallpossiblesubvertices(object)} and * {@link getallsubstates(object)} are duplicates as implemented for mdr. * it is not clear from the javadoc or usage whether they should do different * things or this just happened because no one noticed we already had * another method. * * @param compstate * the given compositestate * @return all substates
DOCUMENTATION	uml 1.4 spec is ambiguous - english says no association or generalization but ocl only includes association || model.getfacade().isageneralization(dm)
IMPLEMENTATION	sublist.clear() sublist is supposed to share same backing store as list todo in rubyarray. asserttrue(list.size() == 1)
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme arg_concat missing for opt_call_args
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add serialization support for images
IMPLEMENTATION	* * list of checkliststatuses. * * indexed on the model element itself. * todo should use weak references so that this is forgotten about * when the object is removed.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check this
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if too many open files gc and try again
IMPLEMENTATION	* * this panel contains radio buttons that represent the changeability * of an asssociation-end. * * @author jaap.branderhorst@xs4all.nl * @since jan 4 2003 * * todo for uml 2.x this needs to be changed to be just readonly (frozen) * or not (changeable).
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mark diagram/project as dirty?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo the copy function is not yet * completely implemented - so we will * have some exceptions here and there.
IMPLEMENTATION	for tagged values use their containing modelelement since they do not have property panels of their own todo may want to do this for other types too?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if this is ok (this is literally adapted from nsuml)
IMPLEMENTATION	associations not supported yet todo create appropriate classdiagramedge
IMPLEMENTATION	todo call config with scope but no frame
IMPLEMENTATION	* todo this transformation is java specific. we need a more * language/notation scheme for specifying qualified names. * possible algorithm - replace all punctuation with our * internal separator replace multiple separators with a single * instance (for languages like c++). what about i18n? - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this the right range here?
IMPLEMENTATION	assert arrays.aslist(properties).contains( event.getpropertyname()) event.getpropertyname() todo do we really always need to do this or only if notationprovider is null?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo what does the output directory have to do with the class path? project p = projectmanager.getmanager().getcurrentproject() entries.add(p.getprojectsettings().getgenerationoutputdir())
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use reflection against the test case to ensure that it does not import non-argouml classes
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i suspect this is not needed call is not needed but do not remove till out of alpha/beta stage
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this is updating model on a per character basis as well as unregistering/reregistering event listeners every character - very wasteful - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo rework to use uml 1.4 tagdefinitions - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not all namespaces are useful here - any wfrs?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo before allowing this we should really check that templateparameter.defaultelement is defined
IMPLEMENTATION	todo review all callers to make sure that they localize the title in process by harold braun 20070912
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme we may be intern'ing more than once.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why are these different colors? - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ruby unlocks the string here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this is not handling multibyte yet
IMPLEMENTATION	todo create uk loaders for component properties
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we limit stored procedures ?!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo avoid this for non-new instances where mightbedirty==false
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this code can be removed when getcurrentproject is removed
IMPLEMENTATION	todo allow user to request the system or no parent
IMPLEMENTATION	todo assertion only could be optimized away
IMPLEMENTATION	* * this method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the * ejbfiles and compares them to the timestamp on the jarfile * . if the jarfile's timestamp is more recent than * each ejb file true is returned. otherwise false * is returned. * todo find a way to check the manifest-file that is found by naming convention * * @param ejbfiles hashtable of ejb classes (and other) files that will be * added to the completed jar file * @param jarfile jar file which will contain all of the ejb classes (and * other) files * @return boolean indicating whether or not the jarfile * is up to date
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo should also make sure that each of the columns is made ""not null"""
IMPLEMENTATION	todo put throws clause back in empty method.
IMPLEMENTATION	not implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why are not these the same?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why is this disabled always?
IMPLEMENTATION	* * called when app shutdown. * todo put throws clause back in
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should we be doing anything on deleted elements? this throws an exception on remove events. - skip for now - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement iterate() todo implement sortedby() todo implement subsequence()
IMPLEMENTATION	ignored - it should not have been in the project in the 1st place
IMPLEMENTATION	not implemented yet
IMPLEMENTATION	todo somehow show progress
IMPLEMENTATION	not yet handled
IMPLEMENTATION	* have we reached the reporting boundary? * need to allow for a margin of error otherwise can miss the slot. * also need to check we have not hit the window already
IMPLEMENTATION	enable it. todo this by default selects all modules that are found. eventually we would rather obey a default either from the modules themselves from how they are found and also have information on what modules are selected from the configuration.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle parse error
IMPLEMENTATION	i do not know if this should be run this deferred because we might have to give the editor a chance to process the viewer update events and hence to update the views first.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo show dialog
IMPLEMENTATION	todo localize filter action names
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is this a good way of handling nested notation? * the following fails the tests * new transitionnotationuml(t).parse(line)
TEST	todo - need a lot more tests
TEST	todo enable some proper tests!!
TEST	todo we need some way of driving this from panel xml rather than hard coded test
TEST	need better test for windows
TEST	"does not work depending on the compression engine used compressed bytes may differ. false errors would be reported. asserttrue(""file content mismatch"" file_utils.contentequals(project.resolvefile(""expected/asf-logo-huge.tar.bz2"") project.resolvefile(""asf-logo-huge.tar.bz2"")))"
TEST	"the uml 2.1.1 metamodel is a mof 2.0 cmof model so we want nodes with tag=""ownedmember"" attribute xmitype=""cmofclass"" todo this code is untested - tfm"
TEST	the plot field is not tested
TEST	todo add test methods here. the name must begin with 'test'. for example
