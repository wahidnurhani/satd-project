DEFECT	fixme formatters are not thread-safe
DEFECT	sss fixme there are also differences in variable scoping between 1.8 and 1.9 ruby 1.8 is the buggy semantics if i understand correctly. the semantics of how this shadows other variables outside the block needs to be figured out during live var analysis.
DEFECT	todo check if we have to manually set the folder/uid in message controller to make this work
DEFECT	todo fix parser exception
DEFECT	the following constants capture pre-known static call sites -- jruby implementations of methods of ruby classes sss fixme note that compiler/impl/basebodycompiler is using op_match2 for match() and and op_match for match2 is this a bug there?
DEFECT	fixme throw the right argumenterror's if the class is missing or if it is a module.
DEFECT	fb will not compile with vaj or no_jikes fb object adapter = adapterfactory.adapt(mapping)
DEFECT	fixme it may be possible to killpg on systems which support it. posix library needs to tell whether a particular method works or not
DEFECT	xxx actually only on windows
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk fix this! -> only if/when we can extract the id values .
DEFECT	todo this is kind of inconsistent with collectiontype
DEFECT	three general cases we check here as to whether to render a physical sql join 1) is our parent a dotnode as well? if so our property reference is being further de-referenced 2) is this a dml statement 3) we were asked to generate any needed joins (generatejoins==true) *or* we are currently processing a select or from clause (an additional check is the regression_style_join_suppression check solely intended for the test suite) the regression_style_join_suppression is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite. this forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser. the underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of cases. the piece it generally tends to miss is that inner joins effect the results by further restricting the data set! a particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit joins *if the query is shallow* the result being that query.list() and query.iterate() could return different number of results!
DEFECT	todo passing null here because this method is not really used for dom4j at the moment but it is still a bug if we do not get rid of this!
DEFECT	do not generate private or loosely typed fields note loose types are not currently parsed anyway
DEFECT	i wonder if the lack of this broke anything in the past?
DEFECT	does it matter that this does not set the type correctly?
DEFECT	bug if there are multiple selections in different contexts the wrong comment strings will be inserted.

DEFECT	this would be sensible but does not work public int hashcode() { return propmap.hashcode() }
DEFECT	todo remove this when frontbase bug gets fixed. for some reason frontbase renames the unique indexes to a generated value. since we do not know what that new name for the index is skip dropping it for now.
DEFECT	bug 2480365 it is very important to get the uri from the url and not simply do new file(url.getfile()). in the case where the path contains spaces they get encoded as %20 in the string returned from url.getfile(). java.io.file does not know how to deal with them (i.e. replace them with spaces) and the resulting file is rendered non-existent.
DEFECT	todo why is this clearing the name?!?! - tfm
DEFECT	todo the size of text figs which is what we care about most is not computed correctly by gef. if we got ambitious we could recompute a proper size ourselves.
DEFECT	todo make the tree refresh and expand * really work in all cases!
DEFECT	todo {name} is not expanded for diagram objects
DEFECT	todo assumes public todo this is probably an undesirable side effect unless the user confirms it. placing an element on a second diagram is going to potentially change its namespace. - tfm 20061208
DEFECT	todo the following can be removed if selectall gets fixed
DEFECT	todo the below is not strictly correct but should cover the case we deal with. using a real xml parser would be better. look for xml document has just a single root element
DEFECT	todo this error needs to be reported!
DEFECT	todo in this case the properties panel is not updated with the changed expression!
DEFECT	"this is turned off temporarily. there appears to be a bug in selectorutils.matchpattern() where it is recursive on windows even if no ** is in pattern. assertequals(""ffftffffffff"" results) unix vs assertequals(""ffftfffftfff"" results) windows"

DESIGN	todo lots more types - duration instance interval
DESIGN	todo encountering a deleted object during any part of this traversal will abort the rest of the traversal. we probably should do the whole traversal in a single mdr transaction.

DESIGN	* delete a model element. implements 'cascading delete' to make sure * model is still valid after element has been deleted. * * the actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the * factories. for example a method deleteclass exists on corehelper. delete * methods as deleteclass should only do those extra actions that are * necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself. i.e. deleteclass * should only take care of things specific to umlclass. * * the delete methods in the uml factories should not be called directly * throughout the code! calls should always refer to this method and never * call the deletexxx method on xxxfactory directly. the reason that it is * possible to call the deletexxx methods directly is a pure implementation * detail. * * the implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if/then/else * tree. this is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to * the uml 1.4 metamodel. the last remark refers to the fact that the * uml 1.4 model uses multiple inheritance in several places. * this has to be taken into account. * * todo the requirements of the metamodel could probably be better * determined by reflection on the metamodel. then each association * that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure * that it meets the requirements and if not be deleted. - tfm * * extensions and its children are not taken into account here. they do not * require extra cleanup actions. not in the form of a call to the remove * method as is normal for all children of mbase and not in the form of * other behaviour we want to implement via this operation. * * @param elem * the element to be deleted * * @see org.argouml.model.umlfactorydelete(java.lang.object)

DESIGN	todo are not our items always strings? - tfm 20100917
DESIGN	* * todo use it notify set to true to forward events to model. only one of * language and body fields should have this set to true.
DESIGN	todo we should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default. this depends on the default profile configuration containing the type integer to test properly. otherwise it will get created in the main project defeating the purpose

DESIGN	houston we have a problem !!
DESIGN	i guess this can happen as a result of a bad file read? in this case it would be better to replace the incorrect value with anything valid e.g. the default value for the property. but for the time being i just prefer to be aware of any problems occuring here most likely programming errors so I will bail out. (ms note) cannot bail out - newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults. also when loading previous versions of jmeter test scripts some values may not be right and should get default values - ms todo review this and possibly change to

DESIGN	* * returns all states that can be recursively contained by the given state. * * todo {@link getallpossiblesubvertices(object)} and * {@link getallsubstates(object)} are duplicates as implemented for mdr. * it is not clear from the javadoc or usage whether they should do different * things or this just happened because no one noticed we already had * another method. * * @param ostate * the composite state we are searching the states for * @return collection the collection with found states
DESIGN	todo what do we want to use as an equivalent here?
DESIGN	* * brooms all the message which y coordinate is upper than the position * of the broom. * todo provide a modefactory and then this class can become package scope. * @author penyaskito
DESIGN	* * returns names of all metamodel value elements including datatypes * enumerations and primitive types. * * todo this method rightly belongs in a separate interface dealing * with instances of mof types as opposed to uml types like all the * rest of the methods here do. * * @return collection containing strings with names of all metatypes
DESIGN	* * called by the constructor to create the figs at each end * of the association. * todo this is temporary during refactoring process. we should * override setdestfignode and setsourcefignode and create the ends there. * that will allow the same pattern to work for uml2 where we cannot assume * the connection order. * * @param sourceassociationend * @param destassociationend * @param settings
DESIGN	todo tagdefinitions are gone from uml 2 they are now properties of stereotypes
DESIGN	"todo still not used because in argouml string is ""hardwired"""
DESIGN	todo not sure whether the above is better in some cases but the code below is better for both java web start and eclipse.
DESIGN	todo this assumes ranges are sorted. is this true? - tfm
DESIGN	todo the javadoc specifies that null should be returned if 'from' or 'to' are null or if there are no associations between them. we should return an empty collection instead and the javadoc should be changed.
DESIGN	todo booleanexpresion is removed from uml2.x is it ok to use valuespecification?
DESIGN	todo use getmodelelementcontainer for transition
DESIGN	todo why are we duplicating the constants here and then in fileconstants below? fileconstants is included in io.
DESIGN	todo no java stringity
DESIGN	modules are included with a shim class we must find that shim to handle super() appropriately
DESIGN	todo figure out how this can happen and possibly remove
DESIGN	in fact we should probably raise an error yes?
DESIGN	sss fixme this should never get called for constant svalues
DESIGN	fixme this below is temporary but its much safer for cow (it prevents not shared strings with begin != 0) this allows now e.g. bytelistset not to be begin aware
DESIGN	todo is there a better way?
DESIGN	"ugly hack for cases like ""elements(foo.bar.collection)"" (multi-part path expression ending in elements or indices)"
DESIGN	we do not know either type blind guess!
DESIGN	"add a ""self"" recv here todo is this right?"
DESIGN	worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here
DESIGN	todo yuck!!! fix after hhh-1907 is complete
DESIGN	polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps well actually its ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here which it will be
DESIGN	fixme we should also support orgs that use capitalized package names (including embarrassingly the one i work for) but this should be enabled by a system property as the expected default behavior for an upper-case value should be (and is) to treat it as a class name and raise an exception if it is not found
DESIGN	todo ary_sort_check should be done here
DESIGN	fixme this does not actually support anything but string
DESIGN	todo confirm expected args are irubyobject (or similar)
DESIGN	sss fixme maybe this is not really a concern after all nesting level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scopes in the current file -- this is not to be confused with semantic nesting of scopes across files. consider this code in a file f class m1m2m3c end so c is at lexical nesting level of 1 (the file script is at 0) in the file 'f' semantically it is at level 3 (m1 m2 m3 are at 012). this is primarily used to ensure that variable names do not clash! i.e. definition of %v_1 in a closure should not override the use of %v_1 from the parent scope! private int _lexicalnestinglevel
DESIGN	arguments compilers always create irubyobject[] but we want to use rubyarray.concat here fixme as a result this is not efficient since it creates and then later unwraps an array
DESIGN	add method with full signature so it is guaranteed to be directly accessible todo no need for this to be a full formal jvm signature
DESIGN	we always prepend an org.jruby.proxy package to the beginning because java and javax packages are protected and signed jars prevent us generating new classes with those package names. see jruby-2439.
DESIGN	workaround for a bug in sun's jdk 1.5.x see
DESIGN	this is gross but java api's are not iso 8601 compliant at all
DESIGN	fixme this is gross. do not do this.
DESIGN	todo this is actually now returning the scope of whoever called methodto_proc which is obviously wrong but there is no scope to provide for many methods. it fixes jruby-2237 but needs a better solution.
DESIGN	again should not happen. todo might want to throw exception instead.
DESIGN	these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us.
DESIGN	todo nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter.
DESIGN	check it out also ugly.
DESIGN	what is the property supposed to be?
DESIGN	xxx (jon skeet) any reason for writing a message and then using a bare runtimeexception rather than just using a buildexception here? is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers (as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure)?
DESIGN	xxx is this code still necessary? is there any 1.2+ port? pull in *.zip from packages directory
DESIGN	this is the old way and is deprecated - classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
DESIGN	provide public visibility
DOCUMENTATION	todo cannot see anything in spec
DOCUMENTATION	* * **fixme** this function needs documentation * * @return vector *
DOCUMENTATION	todo the recurrence goes in front of the action? * does this not contradict the header javadoc?
DOCUMENTATION	todo investigate typo in spec!!
DOCUMENTATION	* * this class manages the windows for the application. * * todo correct these notes * when a session closes the window manager will ensure that * all of the windows for that sesion are closed. * similarily when a window is closed the windows manager will ensure that * references to the window are removed for the session. * * jason prior to this patch there was some code movement from this class to * sessionmanager. the idea being that sessionmanager was the controller. * do we still want to do this? remember in the future there will probably be * an sdi as well as mdi version of the windows. * * @author colin bell * @author jason height
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i think we need to make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the paint instances are always immutable so they are ok
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check for ascii string
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implementation?
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo use the svgwriter2d implementation cmd = new savesvgaction2(translator.localize(""action.save-svg""))"
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme implement this
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme arg_concat logic missing for opt_call_args
IMPLEMENTATION	this may not actually make any difference at present (the code behind addtrigger needs more work).
IMPLEMENTATION	todo ignore and report exception until gettop implemented.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo replace the functioncall in the next line * by .requestfocusinwindow() once * we do not support java 1.3 any more.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this comparison is very suspect it should use equals method. the code within the block is in fact never executed. i hesitate to change this now as it will trigger code has never been used before and am not aware of any problems that it usage may introduce. i do think that we need to be able to find a different way to implement the intent here which seems to be to correct edge drawings that should actually not be allowed - bob
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make threadsafe
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme create attrreadermethod attrwritermethod for faster attr access
IMPLEMENTATION	* * stylepanel which adds a checkbox to show or hide the stereotype. * todo i18n. * * @author mvw@tigris.org
IMPLEMENTATION	* * return the fully qualified name of a model element in java (dot * separated) format. * * todo we really need a language independent format here. perhaps the list * of names that form the hierarchy? - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other name kinds
IMPLEMENTATION	* * utility function to localize the given string with help text * and show it in the status bar of the argouml window. * this function is used in favour of the inline call * to enable later improvements e.g. it would be possible to * show a help-balloon. todo work this out. * one matter to possibly improve show multiple lines. * * @param s the given string to be localized and shown
IMPLEMENTATION	todo after removing a region reset the overall size of the node.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo with new reference resolving scheme the model sub-system will cache the systemid of the profile open it and resolve the profile on its own. thus the java.util.list will be found and the return value will be present again assertnotnull(returnparamtype)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo else alert
IMPLEMENTATION	todo unfinished implementation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo is it removed from uml2 ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mri is just a when node. we need this extra logic for ide consumers (null in casenode statement should be implicit nil)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo it would be better to defer this initialization until the panel actually needs to be displayed. perhaps optimistically always return true and figure out later if we have got something to display - tfm - 20070110
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this code should really check if a ruby equals method is implemented or not.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this is going to because the color to be reset on a refresh
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mri also can hadle bignum here
IMPLEMENTATION	filter out any java primitive names todo should check against all java reserved names here not just primitives
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i do not really like this implementation it would be better if this was handled by searchfordirtycollections()
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe call it getrowselection() ?
IMPLEMENTATION	* * todo check if mimer sql cannot handle the way db2 does
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why is this a special case? - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo no methods yet for getclassname todo no method for newinstance using a reverse-classloader
IMPLEMENTATION	todo validate existing of property with the chosen name. (secondpass )
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add support for read_write ( + nonstrict_read_write ??? )
IMPLEMENTATION	todo create the child index st
IMPLEMENTATION	?? future may want to create tablepopupmenu to allow cut/copy/paste operations
IMPLEMENTATION	move any i18n files that are located in the core downloads dir to the i18n downloads dir. the spring application context will not load properly (for some unknown reason) when there are i18n jars in the classpath. so as a work-around we simply ensure that they are where they should be anyway. previously we were not as careful about this so it is possible that i18n jars were copied into the core downloads directory.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if lock.gettimestamp().equals(ts)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo register listener for target todo item changes and for new showstep() requests
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe should stop at first or find highest priority.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo needs completing - stub implementation only! - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support real types
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement me!
IMPLEMENTATION	html - quoting is done by inserting a div around the message formattet with a blue line at left edge todo (@author fdietz) implement quoting (font color stylesheet blockquote???)
IMPLEMENTATION	need to calculate this just fudging here for now.
IMPLEMENTATION	* * an output stream that compresses into the bzip2 format (without the file * header chars) into another stream. todo update to bzip2 1.0.1 * * @author keiron liddle
IMPLEMENTATION	allow the mimetype of the file to control the content type this is not obvious in gui if you are not uploading any files but just sending the content of nameless parameters todo needs a multiple file upload scenerio
IMPLEMENTATION	todo comments are not sent to recordvalues
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we have any potential consumers of the unversioned name outside of the notation subsystem?
IMPLEMENTATION	if current char is comma insert line break after it we should be able to find the comma because the range for enum constants includes all trailing comments up to the separator if targetsourcerangecomputer of astrewrite changes this logic should change to skip comments see org.eclipse.emf.codegen.merge.java.facade.ast.commentawaresourcerangecomputergetenumconstantsourcerange(astnode)
IMPLEMENTATION	todo @author hubms show if there is already a virtual folder for this tag
IMPLEMENTATION	todo (@author karlpeder) implementation of undo/redo missing
IMPLEMENTATION	todo find a better default language todo we should know the notation language since it is us
TEST	todo add tests for reportsavegraphics
TEST	todo test this.
TEST	todo test mac keyboard accelerator changes done here by mlivingstone shortcut key
TEST	todo the '\n' literal here should be a test against retoken.newline which unfortunately may be more than a single character.
TEST	dms this is totally untested.
TEST	todo make into an assert once i get things like blockbodynodes to be implicit nil
TEST	todo make an assert here

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should never be called.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the include failed so if there is an alternative we do not skip it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the feature is a bidirectional reference with a multiplicity-many reverse a composite reverse or a multiplicity-1 reverse that is already set (on value) then we will switch things around and execute this command a little differently because otherwise it is not undoable.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we will assume that all the createcopycommand's and initializecopycommand's can execute.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	wrap any new children and add them to the map. remove each current child from the set of old children.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the entity handler is the best place to resolve and deresolve uris since it can do it there just once to produce the entity. so most often the entity handler will be a uri handler as well and when used as a uri handler will be an identity handler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	does nothing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create ok and cancel buttons by default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we will need to keep track of the information we use to create the command so that we can recreate it in drop.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"this returns either ""eattribute"" or ""ereference"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find the fragment root so that we can generate to the right location (by default).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	absolute path or no path -> absolute path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no device use base's
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a stack to accumulate segments of base except for the last (i.e. skip trailing separator and anything following it) and of relative path
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	matching authorities and no device or path removal

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	2100..214f
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	store the current state in stack.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	chop the last union (all)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point we have (drivingsqlalias) the sql alias of the driving table corresponding to the given user alias. however the driving table is not (necessarily) the table against which we want to apply locks. mainly the exception case here is joined-subclass hierarchies where we instead want to apply the lock against the root table (for all other strategies it just happens that driving and root are the same).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	decide which resultset to get the property value from
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do this here because getextendedmetadata() is used during initialization and the mappings are are populated the first time it is fetched which will miss the packages we add as we initialize the tree.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"an empty path needs to be replaced by a single ""."" if there is no query to distinguish it from a current document reference"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure it is okay.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note this is being used from the process of shutting down a sessionfactory. specific things to consider (1) this clearing of the region should not propagate to other nodes on the cluster (if any) this is the cache-mode-local option bit (2) really just trying a best effort to cleanup after ourselves lock failures etc are not critical here this is the fail-silently option bit
