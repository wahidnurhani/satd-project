DEFECT	mri 1.8 behavior this combination of flags is not allowed
DEFECT	dump the trace and continue this is currently only here for android which seems to have bugs in its enumeration logic
DEFECT	todo this disables laziness even in non-pojo entity modes
DEFECT	todo currently broken for unique-key references (does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object) the owner of the association is not the owner of the id

DEFECT	18 nov 2003 calling this on a drive letter on windows causes drive access
DEFECT	note this method incorrectly caches the method structure. it needs to be cleared when the classloader changes.
DEFECT	very subtle if we leave this for ensurephysicallineisvisible() an extra line will be added to the scroll line count.
DEFECT	but if hypersearch results window is floating the workaround causes problems!
DEFECT	make it stretch vertically todo the curbody must notify modification

DEFECT	note these lines center the about dialog in the current window. some older swing versions have a bug in getlocationonscreen() and they may not make this behave properly.
DEFECT	in case this is called by the awt thread log a message - this is most likey a bug
DEFECT	todo this will not work when the column has values with quotes in them. use preparedstatements instead.

DESIGN	todo this should listen for new target events fired by wizstep.updatetabtodo so that we can decouple it from the projectbrowser.
DESIGN	todo at the moment setselectedcomponent does not take into account the rather complex tab selection mechanism of detailspane. the tab selection mechanism must be refactored.
DESIGN	todo this should happen in gef
DESIGN	todo do not use hardcoded colors here - tfm
DESIGN	todo support nested let expressions !
DESIGN	todo there are cyclic dependencies between actionstereotypeview* and fignodemodelelement. register these actions opaquely since we do not what they are. - tfm
DESIGN	hack do not show first column where the model element object is placed.
DESIGN	* todo as currently coded this actually returns all behavioralfeatures * which are owned by classifiers contained in the given namespace which * is slightly different then what is documented. it will not include any * behavioralfeatures which are part of the namespace but which do not have * an owner.
DESIGN	do not wait on ourselves we will deadlock! todo we might want to throw an exception here
DESIGN	* * todo mvw would it not be better if this code * would go in starttexteditor() not overruling mouseclicked(). * but we made this fig not editable * to stop it from reacting on key-presses. * anyhow - this is a hack - abusing a figtext - gef does * not really support double-clicking on a fig to trigger some action.
DESIGN	todo we should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here
DESIGN	the next 4 lines fix the 2nd half of issue 5638. * is there no better way?
DESIGN	* * the target model element * in uml1.x this is the element that owns the expression. * in uml2.x this is the expression itself * todo this makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses * should be considered.
DESIGN	name is set to the empty string (yuck!) by default - fix it
DESIGN	there shall not be a dependency from to
DESIGN	* * todo this function attempts to optimize the more generic * code in the parent which also works correctly in this case. * is this a good idea?
DESIGN	todo having critics actions here introduces an unnecessary dependency on the critics subsystem. have it register its desired actions using an extension mechanism - tfm
DESIGN	* * creates a uml model element of the given type. * this only works for uml elements. if a diagram contains * elements of another type then it is the responsibility * of the diagram manage those items and not call this * method. it also only works for uml model elements that * are represented in diagrams by a node. * * @param elementtype the type of model element to build * @return the model element * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo is this needed?
DESIGN	* * returns the destination of a relation or link. the destination of a * relation is defined as the modelelement that receives this * relation. if there are more then 1 destinations only the * first is returned. if there is no destination null is * returned. examples of sources include classifiers that are * types to associationends usecases that are bases to extend and * include relations and so on. in the case of an association * the destination is defined as the type of the second element in * the connections list. * * todo move this method to a generic modelhelper * * @param relationship is the relation * @return object
DESIGN	java 1.6.0_22+ no longer allows content-length to be set so do not check it. see todo any point in checking the other headers?
DESIGN	could we drop the sync here?
DESIGN	todo is null correct?
DESIGN	todo what is this for?
DESIGN	todo should this be getmin()?
DESIGN	todo - should this be a failure?
DESIGN	todo make static?
DESIGN	todo can this ever happen?
DESIGN	hack save the package for any transaction controllers
DESIGN	todo strings should be resources
DESIGN	todo this is a bit fragile
DESIGN	todo is this the correct default?
DESIGN	maybe we should consider creating a global cache for the random files to make jmeter more efficient.
DESIGN	todo should we allow null for non-primitive types?
DESIGN	todo validate contenttype for reasonable types?
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ so it agrees with above todo perhaps should share code with __time() function for this $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-2$ $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-2$

DESIGN	todo should this also clear isdynamic rawparameters permanentresults?
DESIGN	* notused private void initbuttonmap() { }
DESIGN	todo turn into method?
DESIGN	why does this not call guiinstance.cleartestplan() ? is there a reason for not clearing everything?
DESIGN	todo copy/paste from insertrows()
DESIGN	todo is this 100% correct?
DESIGN	todo is this really necessary????
DESIGN	?? extract this out into a class like cascadeinternalframepositioner.
DESIGN	todo would be great to have a mappinghasnonidentifierpropertynamedid method i do not believe that mappinggetreferencedpropertytype accounts for the identifier property so if it returns for a property named 'id' then we should have a non-id field named id
DESIGN	todo what else to do here?
DESIGN	todo simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
DESIGN	todo does this really need to be here? does the collection already have it is own up-to-date snapshot?
DESIGN	before cascade! todo should this be session.instantiate(persister )?
DESIGN	todo not sure this is correct could not find docs on how to do this.
DESIGN	"for dom4j ""collections"" only todo it would be better if this was done at the higher level by printer"
DESIGN	todo *two* hashmap lookups here is one too many
DESIGN	todo move to stringhelper?
DESIGN	todo why should not we call registersqldriver here? rmm 20070401
DESIGN	todo should the constraint name simply be the column name or something more like a constraint name?
DESIGN	jason make menu smarter. when second window for the same session is added create a hierarchical menu for all windows for the session.
DESIGN	maybe move to vector if mt problems occur
DESIGN	todo pass in a message handler so user gets error msgs.
DESIGN	* todo spring-inject when this class is a spring bean
DESIGN	should probably create my own table model but i am being a bit slack.
DESIGN	todo figure out why the selection of the root node in the object tree is undone if we do not delay. it seems like some other thread racing to set the selected node to none. when this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when a session is first opened or when an objecttree frame is created. this is a really crappy and unreliable way to fix this problem but it hides the problem for now. a better understanding of the architecture of session creation is required before a proper solution can be attempted. rmm 20051217
DESIGN	copied from java doc matcher.replaceall note that backslashes (\) and dollar signs ($) in the replacement string may because the results to be different than if it were being treated as a literal replacement string. dollar signs may be treated as references to captured subsequences as described above and backslashes are used to escape literal characters in the replacement string.
DESIGN	need to somehow call sqlresultexecuterpanel.rerunselectedresulttab(true) something like sqlresultexecuterpanel panel = getpanel() panel.rerunselectedresulttab(true) however that does not apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table. there needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders. for now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually re-run the query / reload the table data and re-export.
DESIGN	this refactoring depends on the following dialect api methods getupdatesql
DESIGN	"this is a work-around for what looks like a bug to me - it is a syntax error to qualify with the schema the new table name but not the old as in alter table ""public"".""tablerenametest"" rename to ""public"".""tablewasrenamed"" the second ""public"". is apparently not (currently) a valid thing to do."
DESIGN	this should just bring back one table i hope.
DESIGN	* * mode to create a link between two figclassifierroles. * todo provide a modefactory and then this class can become package scope. * @author penyaskito
DESIGN	todo this attribute should be transferred to the renderer state.
DESIGN	fixme we should really assert a value
DESIGN	a redraw should not trigger another change event
DESIGN	todo (@author fdietz) move this to abstractmessagefolder constructor create filterlist datastructure
DESIGN	now we handle some special cases - yes ugly code alert!
DESIGN	here is a quirk - the api has been defined in terms of a plain timeperiod which cannot make use of the timezone and locale specified in the constructor so we only do the time zone pegging if the period is an instanceof regulartimeperiod
DESIGN	this is a big festering hack to make the images the right size from the start.
DESIGN	eatm kind of hacky.
DESIGN	todo I am concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403. so should we consider something to exist even though access if unauthorized or forbidden?
DESIGN	todo fix the space above
DESIGN	* * this form used from annotations (?). essentially the same as the above using a * resultset-mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment. * * fixme annotations do not use it so it can be remove from my pov * @deprecated * * * @param query the sql query string * @param resultsetref the result-set-mapping name * @param queryspaces any specified query spaces (used for auto-flushing) * @param cacheable whether the query results are cacheable * @param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the results * @param timeout a jdbc-level timeout to be applied * @param fetchsize a jdbc-level fetch-size to be applied * @param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query * @param parametertypes parameter type map * @param callable does the query string represent a callable object (i.e. proc)
DESIGN	todo factor up into genbaseimpl
DESIGN	if the delegate uri can be handled as a file we will hope that renaming it will be really efficient.
DESIGN	todo iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions 1) transientcopycache.size() == 0 2) transientcopycache.size() is not decreasing and copycache.size() is not increasing todo find out if retrying can add entities to copycache (do not think it can ) for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there are still any transient entities
DESIGN	todo @author hubms copied from frederiks search builder
DESIGN	register interest on store changes todo the dependency should be the other way around
DESIGN	todo is this a bit ugly?
DESIGN	fixme clone generator
DESIGN	needs to be improved !!!
DESIGN	todo (@author fdietz) add more special entities - e.g. accenture chars such as ?
DESIGN	turn of focus stealing (workaround should be removed in the future!)
DESIGN	todo real I am status here
DESIGN	"@author fdietz problem extensions do not run using java webstart (jws) even though we assign ""all-permission"" in our columba.jnlp file this only applies to the initial java webstart classloader. but we create our own classloaders for loading extensions. these classloaders do not have the same permission settings anymore."
DESIGN	todo open stream from the mime part specified by contentid of the currently viewed mail
DESIGN	todo (@author fdietz) move this to abstractmessagefolder constructor
DESIGN	todo (@author hubms) implement custom menuitem renderer
DESIGN	revisit remove this code. store port value as string instead of integer.
DESIGN	issues to resolve here 1) in which classloader should we define the class? if there is a bshclassloader should we define it there? 2) should we use reflection to set it in a non-bsh classloader if there is one or should we always create a bsh classloader (and expose its defineclass)?
DESIGN	is this right?
DESIGN	wrap nulls. this is a bit of a cludge to address a deficiency in the class generator whereby it does not wrap nulls on method delegate. see class generator.java. if we fix that then we can remove this. (just have to generate the code there.)
DESIGN	spacing workaround
DESIGN	this could be static
DESIGN	null value is just a declaration note we might want to keep any existing value here instead of reset
DESIGN	todo what type?
DESIGN	todo really bad evil hack to fix!!!
DESIGN	do we need to drop constraints before dropping tables in this dialect?
DESIGN	todo not so sure this is needed
DESIGN	todo this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a property reference per-se.
DESIGN	workaround for backward compatibility of sets with no not-null columns assume all columns are used in the row locator sql
DESIGN	use of trim() here is ugly?
DESIGN	"these are used to eliminate code duplication. i do not normally use the visitor or ""template method"" pattern but this code was contributed by peter cox and i do not feel like changing it around too much."
DESIGN	this method should be rewritten to use getfields() and avoid catching exceptions during the search.
DESIGN	(should we cache info in not a class case too?)
DESIGN	per schema 1.0 it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid uri. for the future if we plant to support iris then it is better not to massage the initialvalue. we should thought consider where would be the best way to validate anyuri values -- el
DESIGN	xxx does this really belong here?
DESIGN	this is stupid and misleading. * but 'path' is not used anywhere except * the above line and if this is done * after the 'continue' then we will * either hang or be forced to duplicate * it inside the buffer == null or add * a 'finally' clause. you decide which one's * worse.
DESIGN	{{{ windows work around
DESIGN	compatibility kludge for jedit 3.1 and earlier
DESIGN	somewhat of a hack. if the special fields are visible (we are operating relative to a 'this' type already) dissallow further .this references to prevent user from skipping to things like super.this.caller
DESIGN	parse pattern into tokens. does anyone know if it is more efficient to use char[] than a string.charat()? I am assuming so.
DESIGN	perhaps if xerces was not slightly brain-damaged we would not need this
DESIGN	this is retarded. excuse me while i drool and make stupid noises
DESIGN	need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack to work
DESIGN	todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters -> the table info gotten here should really be self-contained (i.e. a class representation defining all the needed attributes) then we could then get an array of those
DESIGN	* todo are the 3 methods uses ?
DESIGN	fixme should not need @__java_ovrd_methods just query locally defined methods.
DESIGN	* * creates a new field that selects the language for an expression. * * @param m expression model should be shared between * language and body fields * @param n only one of language and body fields should * forward events to model * todo mvw i do not understand that.
DESIGN	todo a minimal update strategy would be better here to minimize work and events firing but it may be better to deprecate the method and force calls to manage updates themselves (since they probably usually want to just add or remove a single element) - tfm 20061108
DESIGN	todo try reusing the same set on every recursion
DESIGN	* * todo copied from umldiagramrenderer. * * find the figs in the given layer that should be the source and * destination and attach these to either end of the figedge * @param layer the layer to look for the fignodes * @param newedge the edge to attach
DESIGN	ignore bean does not get registered todo why does that bother me?
DESIGN	todo callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost (constants are rarely assigned)
DESIGN	this is a rather ugly hack but similar to mri. see hash.cruby_setenv and similar in mri we search all keys for a case-insensitive match and use that
DESIGN	todo this version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it does not perhaps no difference for us?
DESIGN	fixme not very efficient
DESIGN	upper-case package name todo top-level upper-case package was supported in the previous (ruby-based) implementation so leaving as is. see note at getproxyorpackageunderpackage re future approach below the top-level.
DESIGN	todo this is not an exact port of mri's pipe behavior so revisit
DESIGN	* * builds a class with a given name. * * @param name the given name * @return class * @see buildclass() * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo some of these magic numbers probably assume a line width of 1. replace with appropriate constants/variables.
DESIGN	todo comment by a. rueckert i think the handle holding the collaboration implementation should rather be a collaborationuse in uml2. but as a workaround for now I will try to get a collaboration representation (collaborationuse) and then try to get the owning classifier from there
DESIGN	todo remove the casting to diagramfactoryinterface2 as soon as diagramfactoryinterface is removed.
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml method. * * @return an initialized uml method instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	* * create an empty but initialized instance of a uml operation. * * @return an initialized uml operation instance. * todo this needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	todo not sure the semantics are an exact match here between uml 1.4 aggregate and uml 2.x shared.
DESIGN	todo make this work when the given stereotype * has more than one baseclass. * todo currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is * equal to the given one - inheritance does not work.
DESIGN	todo is this adequate for finding profiles in java webstart jars? - tfm
DESIGN	todo more is required here to support referencevalues
DESIGN	todo actionstate callstate and subactivitystate have been replaced in uml 2.0 by explicitly modeled actions
DESIGN	do not implement - deprecated method in interface.
DESIGN	"workaround for missing ability to parse ""*"""
DESIGN	fixme why was this using a fullfunctioncallbackmethod before that did callsuper?
DESIGN	todo this method is not present in mri!
DESIGN	todo determine whether we should perhaps store non-singleton class in the implementationclass
DESIGN	todo these were missing so we are not handling them elsewhere?
DESIGN	bit risky if someone changes completor but useful for method calls
DESIGN	fixme there is some code duplication here with rubyobjectinspect
DESIGN	fixme i think this chunk is equivalent to mri id2name (and not our public method id2name). make into method if used more than once.
DESIGN	todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query-def so as to not have to re-calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset-ref stuff
DESIGN	todo this constructor form is *only* used from constructor directly below us can it go away?
DESIGN	we would probably refactor to have logicparser (builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not) expressionparser (translates from oo terms like foo foo.bar foo.bar.baz to sql terms like foos.id foos.bar_id etc) and pathexpressionparser (which does much the same thing it does now)
DESIGN	todo copy/paste from sessionimpl pull up!
DESIGN	todo make entitypersister *not* depend on sessionfactoryimplementor interface if possible
DESIGN	todo the i==entityspan-1 bit depends upon subclass implementation (very bad)
DESIGN	todo should remove this exposure and have all references to the session's batcher use the connectionmanager.
DESIGN	fixme this is temporary since the variable compilers assume we want args already on stack for assignment. we just pop and continue with 1.9 args logic.
DESIGN	self = args[0] sss fixme verify that this is correct
DESIGN	xxx do something?
DESIGN	if we get here we found a matching method use it todo choose narrowest method by continuing to search
DESIGN	fixme we should probably still be dyncalling 'write' here
DESIGN	todo reads/writes from frame todo information on scoping todo visibility?
DESIGN	fixme clearing read buffer here is this appropriate?
DESIGN	todo make more efficient by not creating irubyarray[]
DESIGN	fixme remove this from grammars.
DESIGN	todo for now we use a faithful reimplementation of mri's algorithm but should use utf8encoding facilities from joni once it starts prefroming utf-8 content validation.

IMPLEMENTATION	* todo not implemented yet. the idea is that some * problems identified by critic's can be fixed with certain design * manipulations (or transforms) that can be applied automatically * to resolve the problem. this method replies true iff the given * problem can be fixed. the fixit() method actually does the fix. * * @see org.argouml.cognitive.postercanfixit(org.argouml.cognitive.todoitem) * also * @see criticfixit
IMPLEMENTATION	todo see if we need to apply some line color and style to the axis traces
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this and recacherespondsto needed to be synchronized for jruby-3466 but this degraded performance nearly 2x. it is still faster than mri but a reanalysis of this code may show a faster way to ensure we are caching safely.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we may return the following when the * relocate() has been implemented.
IMPLEMENTATION	do we have 2 connection ends?
IMPLEMENTATION	"the text box containing the problem messages todo this should be hidden by default but accessible on via a ""details"" button or tab to provide more info to the user."
IMPLEMENTATION	todo support other types of drag. * here you set the owner by dragging into a namespace. * an alternative could be to drag states into composite states
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do something here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo opt for 2 and 3 ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo todoitem stuff should be made an opaque extension
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this needs to be improved even for nongui calling the config panel needs to be initialized
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we should assert this never happens before removing panels should control their own listeners
IMPLEMENTATION	todo a more strongly typed data structure could be used here.
IMPLEMENTATION	* * write todo check if sections are not used within the file and * put them as comments at the end of the file. * hint use a second map to compare with the used keys. * * @param filename the file name * @param indent the current indentation * @param outputlostsections true if lost sections are to be written
IMPLEMENTATION	todo expression and instancevalue (how) if anyone have an example.
IMPLEMENTATION	* * get the innermost containing model of a modelelement. * * if no containing model can be found the outermost containing * modelelement is returned (which could be the original element itself if * it has no owner). * * this method is intended to return the innermost * containing model but there are circumstances where one may * really expect the outermost containing model or root package to * be returned (e.g. where * it is being used to test if two elements are from disjoint namespace * hierarchies). hence there are two separate methods * with different semantics. the method {@link getroot(object)} * returns the outermost containing object. * * todo note also that some code uses * org.argouml.kernel.projectgetroot() to navigate down from the top * instead of up from the bottom. we need to use a consistent algorithm for * this. - tfm 20070724 * * @param handle * to the model element. * @return model for the model element.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo all build/create methods need undo support - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo should we require a graphmodel in the constructor since our implementations of setnamespace are going to try and set the namespace on the graphmodel as well?
IMPLEMENTATION	do not clone cached methods fixme mri copies all methods here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement support for multiple taggedvalues
IMPLEMENTATION	todo correctly implement next function * in the model subsystem for * issue 1942
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme make thread pool threads daemons if necessary
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo add ""unnamed"" or ""new"" or something? (localized of course)"
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme do not use rubyio for this
IMPLEMENTATION	perhaps something like the following would work instead rectangle drawingarea = globals.cureditor().getjcomponent().getvisiblerect()
IMPLEMENTATION	todo terrible implementation!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo for some dialects it would be appropriate to add the renderorderbypropertiesselect() to other select strings
IMPLEMENTATION	todo look at optimizing these
IMPLEMENTATION	todo indicate the direction!
IMPLEMENTATION	* * an output stream that compresses into the bzip2 format (without the file * header chars) into another stream. * the compression requires large amounts of memory. thus you * should call the {@link close() close()} method as soon as * possible to force cbzip2outputstream to release the * allocated memory. * * you can shrink the amount of allocated memory and maybe raise * the compression speed by choosing a lower blocksize which in turn * may because a lower compression ratio. you can avoid unnecessary * memory allocation by avoiding using a blocksize which is bigger * than the size of the input. * * you can compute the memory usage for compressing by the * following formula * * 400k + (9 * blocksize). * * * to get the memory required for decompression by {@link * cbzip2inputstream cbzip2inputstream} use * * 65k + (5 * blocksize). * * * * * * * * * * memory usage by blocksize * * blocksize * compressionmemory usage * decompressionmemory usage * * 100k * 1300k * 565k * * 200k * 2200k * 1065k * * 300k * 3100k * 1565k * * 400k * 4000k * 2065k * * 500k * 4900k * 2565k * * 600k * 5800k * 3065k * * 700k * 6700k * 3565k * * 800k * 7600k * 4065k * * 900k * 8500k * 4565k * * * * for decompression cbzip2inputstream allocates less * memory if the bzipped input is smaller than one block. * * instances of this class are not threadsafe. * * * todo update to bzip2 1.0.1 * *
IMPLEMENTATION	todo get all properties not just the fetched ones!
IMPLEMENTATION	table=null -> an association - fill it in later todo fill in the mappings for table == null
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo perhaps we can tell the user when they click ""copy table"" if the source session is axion and they want primary keys that it is not possible."
IMPLEMENTATION	"todo ask the user if they want to ""undo"" the changes that the paste made. alternatively show them the specific problem and let them fix it. then allow them to retry the operation starting from the point at which the previous operation failed."
IMPLEMENTATION	todo need to implement or change the message
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if we support multiple fetch groups we would need to clone the set of lazy properties!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo this should not require two passes through the list - tfm
IMPLEMENTATION	todo sort the list.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo do we want to use the project here instead of just its name?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check types!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo we can probably release our references to the constantfields array and static/instance callback hashes at this point.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo implement this
IMPLEMENTATION	todo fetch this once as per vars above?
IMPLEMENTATION	implement the recursion for getclassimpl()
IMPLEMENTATION	remind convert arg list vectors here?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo (@author fdietz) add error dialog
IMPLEMENTATION	todo these defaults need to be checked against historical ones
IMPLEMENTATION	todo binary incompatibility an old override must override putall.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo (@author javaprog)sizecombobox can be enabled as paragraphcombobox when implemented
IMPLEMENTATION	fixme threaded-view auto collapse
IMPLEMENTATION	todo reuse the offender list.
TEST	todo add tests for savegraphics
TEST	* * test creation of metatypes. * * todo we could add tests here to make sure that * we can not create abstract types
TEST	todo presumably this is only relevant if obj is actually a model or profile. an added test of isamodel(obj) or isaprofile(obj) would clarify what is going on here.
TEST	todo test that surrogate value is legal.
TEST	not sure whether this test is needed but cost nothing to put. hope it will be reviewed by anybody competent
TEST	* * test the constructor used for loading a profile from a jar file. * todo test fignode! * * @throws exception if something goes wrong
TEST	cleanallextentsbut(model) todo why is this causing a crash?!?
TEST	todo do tests for type conformance (8.4.4) even though it is not yet supported
