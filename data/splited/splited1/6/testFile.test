DEFECT	this is only needed afaict for processing results from the query cache however this cannot possibly work in the case of discovered types...
DEFECT	note that this timestamp is not correct if the connection provider returns an older jdbc connection that was associated with a transaction that was already begun before opensession was called do not know any possible solution to this!
DEFECT	todo this is assertion is disabled because there is a bug that means the original owner of a transient uninitialized collection is not known if the collection is re referenced by a different object associated with the current session throw new assertionfailure bug loading unowned collection
DEFECT	this does not support the cache sql distinct by comma list extensions but this extension is not supported through hibernate anyway.
DEFECT	todo when this is the entry point we should use an inner join for fetching the many to many elements!
DEFECT	could happen for custom criteria impls. not likely but... for long term solution see hhh 3514
DEFECT	todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object the owner of the association is not the owner of the id
DEFECT	todo currently broken for unique key references does not detect change to unique key property of the associated object
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk and entity name fix this!
DEFECT	todo does not work for entitymode.dom4j yet!
DEFECT	todo deal with the optional attribute in the join mapping this code assumes that optional defaults to true because it does not actually seem to work in the fetch join code note that actual proper handling of optional ality here is actually more involved than this patch assumes. remember that we might have multiple join mappings associated with a single entity. really a couple of things need to happen to properly handle optional here 1 first and foremost when handling multiple join s we really should be using the entity root table as the driving table another option here would be to choose some non optional joined table to use as the driving table. in all likelihood just using the root table is much simplier 2 need to add the fk columns corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non optional data is present my initial thoughts on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new sequentialselect abstraction that actually gets generated in the persisters ok singletable... and utilized here. it would encapsulated all this required optional ality checking...
DEFECT	todo not really completely correct since the uoe could occur while resolving associations leaving the pc in an inconsistent state
DEFECT	todo this is kind of inconsistent with collectiontype
DEFECT	for a one to many a bag is not really a bag it is really a set since it cannot contain the same element twice. it could be considered a bug in the mapping dtd that bag allows one to many .
DEFECT	todo entities can be compared by pk fix this! only if when we can extract the id values....
DEFECT	todo old version did not require hashmap lookup keys collectionowner .getidentifier
DEFECT	todo this disables laziness even in non pojo entity modes
DEFECT	todo at the point where we are resolving collection references we do not know if the uk value has been resolved depends if it was earlier or later in the mapping document now we could try and use e.getstatus to decide to semiresolve trouble is that initializeentity reuses the same array for resolved and hydrated values
DEFECT	todo currently we do not know a sessionfactory reference when building the tuplizer this is a bug embedded xml false on component todo fix this after hhh 1907 is complete
DEFECT	todo this requires that the collection is defined after the referenced property in the mapping file ok?
DEFECT	todo currently we really do not handle valueinclusion.partial... valueinclusion.partial would indicate parts of a component need to be included in the select currently we then just render the entire component into the select clause in that case.
DEFECT	todo is this completely correct?
DEFECT	todo what if batchupdate is a callablestatement ? calls executebatch
DEFECT	this does not actually seem to work but it might work on some dbs. also it does not work if there are multiple columns of results because it is not accounting for the suffix return new string getdiscriminatorcolumnname
DEFECT	first validate all the enabled filters... todo this implementation has bad performance
DEFECT	todo passing null here because this method is not really used for dom4j at the moment but it is still a bug if we do not get rid of this!
DEFECT	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know the operand node type where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DEFECT	algorithm check for any level one nullability breaks look at non null components to recursively check next level of nullability breaks look at collections contraining component to recursively check next level of nullability breaks in the previous implementation not null stuffs where checked filtering by level one only updateable or insertable columns. so setting a sub component as update false has no effect on not null check if the main component had good checkeability in this implementation we keep this feature. however i never see any documentation mentioning that but it is for sure a limitation.
DEFECT	assume that the row was not there since it previously had only null values so do an insert instead todo does not respect dynamic insert
DEFECT	todo this call will not work for anything other than pojos!
DEFECT	note that this implementation is kind of broken for components with many to one associations
DEFECT	no need to take a snapshot this is a performance optimization but not really important except for entities with huge mutable property values
DEFECT	todo this is broke for subqueries in statements other than selects...
DEFECT	the following types are not supported in rdms jdbc and therefore commented out. however in some cases mapping them to character columns works for many applications but does not work for all cases.
DEFECT	todo should this be an error?
DEFECT	three general cases we check here as to whether to render a physical sql join 1 is our parent a dotnode as well? if so our property reference is being further de referenced... 2 is this a dml statement 3 we were asked to generate any needed joins generatejoins true or we are currently processing a select or from clause an additional check is the regression style join suppression check solely intended for the test suite the regression style join suppression is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite. this forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser. the underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical sql join in a lot of cases. the piece it generally tends to miss is that inner joins effect the results by further restricting the data set! a particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for toone implicit joins if the query is shallow the result being that query.list and query.iterate could return different number of results!
DEFECT	todo figure out how this should be set. this was the reason for failures regarding index op and subclass joins on theta join dialects not sure what behaviour we were trying to emulate joinsequence joinsequence.getfrompart emulate the old addfromonly behavior.
DEFECT	the preference here would be sqlfunctiontemplate hibernate.timestamp current timestamp ?1 false but this appears not to work. jay nance 2006 09 22
DEFECT	todo inexact what we really need to know is are any outer joins used?
DEFECT	todo would be nice to use false but issues with ms sql
DEFECT	todo not sure which either? is correct could not find docs on how to do this. did find various blogs and forums mentioning that select current timestamp does not work...
DEFECT	todo cannot use generatesuffixes it handles the initial suffix differently.
DEFECT	do not need this because we should never ever be selecting no columns in an insert ... select... and because it causes a bug on db2
DEFECT	starts with an alias old style semi bad thing about this cannot re alias another alias.....
DEFECT	todo bug! this currently fails for named queries for non pojo entities
DEFECT	fixme we do not have the associated entity table name here has to be done in a second pass
DEFECT	this call is side effecty
DEFECT	rdms does not directly support the trim function we use rtrim and ltrim
DEFECT	note at least my local sql server 2005 express shows this not working...
DEFECT	note at least my local mysql 5.1 install shows this not working...
DESIGN	use count as the default. this mimics the old behavior although none might be a better option moving forward in the case of callable
DESIGN	perhaps not really necessary...
DESIGN	todo disable batch loading if lockmode read?
DESIGN	todo to handle concurrent writes correctly the client should pass in a lock
DESIGN	turn hibernate.c3p0. into c3p0. so c3p0 gets a chance to see all hibernate.c3p0.
DESIGN	note there is a wierd implementation in the client side
DESIGN	todo this was added to support initializing an entity s entityentry snapshot during reattach this should be refactored to instead expose a method to assemble a entityentry based on this state for return.
DESIGN	do we need to drop constraints before dropping tables in this dialect?
DESIGN	does this dialect support check constraints?
DESIGN	this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call start
DESIGN	does this dialect support the unique column syntax?
DESIGN	this is done here cos we might only know the type here ugly! todo improve this a lot
DESIGN	does this dialect support the for update syntax?
DESIGN	todo what is the implication of this?
DESIGN	todo yuck!!!
DESIGN	todo again how should this work for non pojo entities?
DESIGN	does this dialect support for update of allowing particular rows to be locked?
DESIGN	todo really bad evil hack to fix!!!
DESIGN	aliasrefnode.resolve false false aliasrefnode.gettext todo is it kosher to do it here? todo is it kosher to do it here?
DESIGN	todo better to degrade to lazy false if uninstrumented
DESIGN	does this dialect support the oracle style for update nowait syntax?
DESIGN	icky workaround for mysql bug
DESIGN	we have to set up the table later!! yuck
DESIGN	todo somehow add the newly created foreign keys to the internal collection
DESIGN	this inner class implements a case statement....perhaps I am being a bit over clever here
DESIGN	todo merge into one method!
DESIGN	todo this is a bit of copy paste from indexedcollection.createprimarykey
DESIGN	todo what type?
DESIGN	todo inefficient
DESIGN	todo this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
DESIGN	todo redesign how propertyaccessors are acquired...
DESIGN	todo not so sure this is needed...
DESIGN	todo joinkeycolumnname foreignkeycolumnname should be called either here or at a slightly higer level in the stack to get all the information we need right now hbmbinder does not support the
DESIGN	todo improve this hack!
DESIGN	todo bad implementation cos it depends upon ordering of mapping doc fixing this requires that collection persistentclass gain access to the mappings reference from configuration or the filterdefinitions map directly sometime during configuration.buildsessionfactory after all the types filter defs are known and before building persisters .
DESIGN	use of trim here is ugly?
DESIGN	todo ideally we need the construction of propertyaccessor to take the following 1 entitymode 2 entitymode specific data i.e. the classname for pojo entities 3 property specific data based on the entitymode i.e. property name or dom4j node name the easiest way with the introduction of the new runtime metamodel classes would be the the following predicates 1 propertyaccessorfactory.getpropertyaccessor takes references to both a org.hibernate.metadata.entitymodemetadata and org.hibernate.metadata.property 2 what is now termed a propertyaccessor stores any values needed from those two pieces of information 3 code can then simply call propertyaccess.getgetter with no parameters likewise with propertyaccessor.getsetter
DESIGN	ick!
DESIGN	todo this is very suboptimal for some subclasses namely components since it does not take advantage of two phase load
DESIGN	todo should this be session.instantiate persister ... ?
DESIGN	todo suck this into initlaziness!
DESIGN	hibernate.temp.use jdbc metadata defaults is a temporary magic value. the need for it is intended to be alleviated with future developement thus it is not defined as an environment constant... it is used to control whether we should consult the jdbc metadata to determine certain settings default values it is useful to not do this when the database may not be available mainly in tools usage .
DESIGN	todo is this right??
DESIGN	ie. the subquery! yuck!
DESIGN	todo copy paste from recreate
DESIGN	workaround for backward compatibility of sets with no not null columns assume all columns are used in the row locator sql
DESIGN	just to help out during the load ugly i know
DESIGN	hack workaround as sqlquery impl depend on having a key.
DESIGN	todo handle the case of a foreign key to something other than the pk
DESIGN	todo assumes all collections disassemble to an array!
DESIGN	todo would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity subclass would emit a notification which the extendsqueue entries could react to...
DESIGN	todo is it really neceassry to provide configuration to collectionpersisters ? should it not be enough with associated class ? or why does entitypersister s not get access to configuration ? the only reason i could see that configuration gets passed to collection persisters is so that they can look up the dom4j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name was applied at the collection element level. are you kidding me? trivial to fix then. just store and expose the node name on the entity persister which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means... .
DESIGN	todo deprecated remove eventually
DESIGN	todo this is a bit dodgy come up with a better way to check this plus see above comment
DESIGN	use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility
DESIGN	todo this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a property reference per se.
DESIGN	todo better to handle dynamic filters through implicit dynamicfilterparameterspecification see the discussion there in dynamicfilterparameterspecification s javadocs as to why it is currently not done that way.
DESIGN	get the right object from the list ... would it be easier to just call getentity ??
DESIGN	todo should record how many properties we have reffered to and if we do not get them all we throw an exception! way better than trial and error
DESIGN	todo this dependency is kind of bad
DESIGN	why does this matter?
DESIGN	important to account for newly saved entities in query todo some kind of check for new status...
DESIGN	todo can we always use the null property approach for everything?
DESIGN	does this need holdlock also? return tablename with updlock rowlock holdlock
DESIGN	for sets we should end the collection load after resolving the entities since we might call hashcode on the elements todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	todo remove this and just have subclasses use isolater isolatedwork directly...
DESIGN	sql server at least needed this dropped after use strange!
DESIGN	is it necessary to register exact since it can only appear in a where clause?
DESIGN	for arrays we should end the collection load before resolving the entities since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading todo or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	does this dialect support the alter table syntax?
DESIGN	this next bit is to allow for both unsaved value negative and for older behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object todo shift it into unsaved value strategy
DESIGN	todo reenable if we also fix the above todo
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during copy??
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during merge??
DESIGN	todo suck this logic into the collection!
DESIGN	todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming entityentry s
DESIGN	todo this bit actually has to be called after all cascades! but since identity insert is called synchronously instead of asynchronously as other actions it is not
DESIGN	this class has no proxies so do a shortcut
DESIGN	todo should this be an initializeentityeventlistener??? watch out for performance!
DESIGN	todo need map? the prob is a proper key right?
DESIGN	todo better to pass the id in as an argument?
DESIGN	do we even really need this? the update will fail anyway....
DESIGN	todo would it be better to do a refresh from db?
DESIGN	this form used from annotations ? . essentially the same as the above using a resultset mapping reference but without cachemode readonly and comment. fixme annotations do not use it so it can be remove from my pov deprecated param query the sql query string param resultsetref the result set mapping name param queryspaces any specified query spaces used for auto flushing param cacheable whether the query results are cacheable param cacheregion if cacheable the region into which to store the results param timeout a jdbc level timeout to be applied param fetchsize a jdbc level fetch size to be applied param flushmode the flush mode to use for this query param parametertypes parameter type map param callable does the query string represent a callable object i.e. proc
DESIGN	todo ugly here
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set... todo calling entryset on an identitymap is slow!!
DESIGN	todo I would much rather have this done from endloadingcollection collectionpersister loadingcollectionentry ...
DESIGN	todo hack!!! note here we cleanup the load context when we have no more local lce entries. this works for the time being because really only the collection load contexts are implemented. long term this cleanup should become part of the close result set processing from the sandbox jdbc jdbc container code.
DESIGN	todo add the notion of enabled filters to the cachekey to differentiate filtered collections from non filtered but cachekey is currently used for both collections and entities would ideally need to define two seperate ones currently this works in conjuction with the check on defaultinitializecollectioneventhandler.initializecollectionfromcache which makes sure to not read from cache with enabled filters . early exit!!!!!
DESIGN	postload is needed for ejb3 todo reuse the postloadevent...
DESIGN	todo should we check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	brand new collection todo or an array!! we cannot lock objects with arrays now??
DESIGN	todo iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions 1 transientcopycache.size 0 2 transientcopycache.size is not decreasing and copycache.size is not increasing todo find out if retrying can add entities to copycache do not think it can... for now just retry once throw transientobjectexception if there are still any transient entities
DESIGN	null or brand new collection this will also inefficiently handle arrays which have no snapshot so we cannot do any better
DESIGN	todo perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved value?
DESIGN	provides query splitting methods which were originally in querytranslator. br todo this will need to be refactored at some point. author josh
DESIGN	todo most of below was taken verbatim from dotnode should either delegate this logic or super type it
DESIGN	todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join. this may not be the case for joined subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy. at some point we should expand this to support that capability. however that has some difficulties 1 the biggest is how to handle ors when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins. 2 here we would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the fromelement so it can pass it along to the joinsequence
DESIGN	no explicit select expression render the id and properties projection lists for every persister in the from clause into a single token node . todo the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filters we should get rid of derived select clause completely!
DESIGN	todo better way?!?
DESIGN	hack alert !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! attempt to work around ghost impliedfromelements that occasionally show up between the actual things being joined. this consistently occurs from index nodes at least against many to many . not sure if there are other conditions essentially look ahead to the next fromelement that actually writes something to the sql
DESIGN	not possible to simply re use the versionpropertynode here as it causes oom errors due to circularity
DESIGN	this function has a template restore output apply the template and write the result out todo downcast to avoid using an interface? yuck.
DESIGN	at some point the generate phase needs to be moved out of here because a single object level dml might spawn multiple sql dml command executions. possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates queryloader statementexecutor themselves. also not sure why queryloader currently even has a dependency on this at all does it need it? ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegates directly...
DESIGN	todo this is only needed during compilation .. can we eliminate the instvar?
DESIGN	todo absolutely no usages of this constructor form can it go away?
DESIGN	todo is this a bit ugly?
DESIGN	even here if only properties mapped to the base table are referenced in the set and where clauses this could be handled by the basicdelegate. todo decide if it is better performance wise to perform that check or to simply use the multitableupdatedelegate
DESIGN	todo remove these last two as batcher is no longer managing connections
DESIGN	very important!!!! this class needs to be free of any static references to any cglib or javassist classes. otherwise users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which if either they use. another option here would be to remove the hibernate.ispropertyinitialized method and have the users go through the sessionfactory to get this information.
DESIGN	todo we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hql sql grammar expects all those node types to be fromreferencenodes. one potential fix here would be to convert the intoclause to just use a fromclause fromelement combo as a child of the insertstatement and move all this logic into the insertstatement. that is probably the easiest approach read least amount of changes to the grammar and code but just does not feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from clauses
DESIGN	todo an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters the table info gotten here should really be self contained i.e. a class representation defining all the needed attributes then we could then get an array of those
DESIGN	todo switch statements are always evil! we already had bugs because of forgotten token types. use polymorphism for this!
DESIGN	really there are two situations where it should be ok to allow the insertion into properties defined on a superclass 1 union subclass with an abstract root entity 2 discrim subclass 1 is handled already because of the fact that unionsubclasspersister alreay always returns 0 for this call... we may want to disallow it for discrim subclass just for consistency sake currently does not work anyway ...
DESIGN	implicit joins are always ? ok to reuse
DESIGN	todo used to be exprnoparens! was this needed?
DESIGN	todo we may also want to check that the types here map to exactly one column jdbc type cannot think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi column mappings makes any sense.
DESIGN	we do not know either type blind guess!
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of here create an ast for the join expressions. use the sql generator grammar to generate the sql text for the index expression.
DESIGN	we would probably refactor to have logicparser builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not expressionparser translates from oo terms like foo foo.bar foo.bar.baz to sql terms like foos.id foos.bar id etc and pathexpressionparser which does much the same thing it does now
DESIGN	short circuit for performance...
DESIGN	not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release
DESIGN	try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name. this allows the we assume custom interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityname
DESIGN	todo this is one of the ugliest and most fragile pieces of code in hibernate....
DESIGN	todo implement functionality this might be painful to do here as the join post processing for the subquery has already been performed meaning that for theta join dialects the join conditions have already been moved over to the where clause . a simple solution here might to perform join post processing once for the entire query including any subqueries at one fell swoop
DESIGN	ignore it the incoming property could not be found so we cannot be sure what to do here. at the very least the safest is to simply not apply any dereference toggling...
DESIGN	todo potentially look at optimizing these two arrays
DESIGN	note that i parameter is now unused delete it?
DESIGN	todo figure out a better way to get the from elements in a proper tree structure. if this is not the destination of a many to many add it as a child of the origin.
DESIGN	todo this constructor form is only used from constructor directly below us can it go away?
DESIGN	we should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad hoc linear approach to processing a stream of tokens we instead build up a tree of expressions.
DESIGN	todo should this get moved to persistentcontext? logically is persistentcontext the thing to which an interceptor gets attached?
DESIGN	todo something much better look at the type of the other expression! todo have comparisonexpression and or arithmeticexpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes.
DESIGN	todo this class does too many things! we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent ways in which path expressions can occur
DESIGN	todo optimize this better!
DESIGN	todo should we allow suffixes on these ?
DESIGN	todo not sure the best way to handle this. the non performant way
DESIGN	todo is there a better way?
DESIGN	the class is now way to complex!
DESIGN	todo would be really nice to cache the spec on the query def so as to not have to re calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset ref stuff...
DESIGN	name from a super query a bit inelegant that it shows up here
DESIGN	real hacky... used to count the nesting of parentheses
DESIGN	ugly hack for cases like elements foo.bar.collection multi part path expression ending in elements or indices
DESIGN	todo copy paste from sessionimpl pull up!
DESIGN	todo need to find a clean way to handle the event source role a seperate classs responsible for generating dispatching events just duplicates most of the session methods... passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionqueue and persistentcontext is not manageable...
DESIGN	must be done here because of side effect! yuck...
DESIGN	we should actually rework this class to not implement parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way.
DESIGN	todo should remove this exposure and have all references to the session s batcher use the connectionmanager.
DESIGN	we may be screwed here since the collection action is about to execute and we do not know the final owner key value
DESIGN	needed the clazz check to work around union subclasses todo is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim column based inheritence?
DESIGN	work around a bug in all known connection pools....
DESIGN	todo reuse the preloadevent
DESIGN	need a better way to define the suffixes here...
DESIGN	workaround for weblogic
DESIGN	todo temporary
DESIGN	todo yuck!!! fix after hhh 1907 is complete
DESIGN	would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff. would need to change the way the max row stuff is handled i.e. behind an interface so that i could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
DESIGN	todo the i entityspan 1 bit depends upon subclass implementation very bad
DESIGN	some messy complex stuff here since createcriteria can take an aliased path or a path rooted at the creating criteria instance
DESIGN	todo add a criteriaimplementor interface this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package...
DESIGN	polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps...well actually its ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here which it will be
DESIGN	this is not very nice and quite slow
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of here
DESIGN	meant to handle dynamic instantiation queries... copy from queryloader
DESIGN	make sure this is a defined parameter and check the incoming value type todo what should be the actual exception type here?
DESIGN	worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here...
DESIGN	todo throw exception? maybe warn if not the same?
DESIGN	todo make entitypersister not depend on sessionfactoryimplementor interface if possible
DESIGN	todo what amount of significant digits need to be supported here? from the decimalformat docs significant digits minimum integer digits maximum fraction digits
DESIGN	for backward compatibility allow a set with no not null element columns using all columns in the row locater sql todo create an implicit not null constraint on all cols?
DESIGN	todo copy paste from manytoonetype
DESIGN	todo code duplication with singletableentitypersister
DESIGN	todo throw exception?
DESIGN	should this interface extend propertymapping?
DESIGN	todo here is why we need to make bytecode provider global todo again fix this after hhh 1907 is complete
DESIGN	todo currently keeps getters and setters instead of propertyaccessors because of the way getgetter and getsetter are implemented currently yuck!
DESIGN	todo yuck! this is not quite good enough it is a quick hack around the problem of having a to one association that refers to an embedded component
DESIGN	todo implement caching?! proxies?!
DESIGN	is this really necessary?
DESIGN	todo this is a little inefficient do not need to do a whole deep replaceelements call
DESIGN	todo this is a bit arbitrary expose a switch to the user?
DESIGN	return collection removal fixme even if isinverse true ?
DESIGN	todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
DESIGN	todo move these to a new joinabletype abstract class extended by entitytype and persistentcollectiontype
DESIGN	todo would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly!
DESIGN	spaces todo I am not sure but perhaps we should exclude abstract denormalized tables?
DESIGN	todo is there a more elegant way than downcasting?
DESIGN	todo remove use of instanceof!
DESIGN	todo make this a bit nicer
DESIGN	todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private...
DESIGN	todo perhaps this should be some other runtimeexception...
DESIGN	yuck
DESIGN	todo need some caching scheme? really comes down to decision regarding amount of state if any kept on propertyaccessors
DESIGN	todo this eventually needs to be removed
DESIGN	todo design new lifecycle for proxyfactory
DESIGN	todo we should really just collect these from the various selectexpressions rather than regenerating here
DESIGN	todo should this really return null? if not figure out something better to do here.
DESIGN	todo should seriously consider not allowing a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session...
DESIGN	should indicate that we are processing an insert update delete query with a subquery implied via a collection property function. here we need to use the table name itself as the qualification alias. todo verify this works for all databases... todo is this also the case in non indexed scenarios?
DESIGN	todo this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DESIGN	todo make this the factory for entity mode related sessions also means making this the target of transaction synch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions at that point perhaps this thing is a sessioncontext and connectionmanager is a jdbccontext ? a sessioncontext should live in the impl package...
DESIGN	create an index on the key columns??
DESIGN	is this ok?
DESIGN	init the table here instead of earlier so that we can get a quoted table name todo would it be better to simply pass the qualified table name instead of splitting it up into schema catalog table names
DESIGN	perhaps this should be an exception since it is only ever used in the above method?
DESIGN	note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass! was tounqotedaliasstrings getdiscriminatorcolumnname before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	put a placeholder in entries so we do not recurse back and try to save the same object again. question should this be done before onsave is called? likewise should it be done before onupdate ?
DESIGN	before cascade! todo should this be session.instantiate persister ... ?
DESIGN	todo we should throw an exception if we really know for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new staleobjectstateexception entityname id
DESIGN	todo the order in which entities are saved may matter e.g. a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entities can be saved keep retrying the batch of transient entities until either 1 there are no transient entities left in transientcopycache or 2 no transient entities were saved in the last batch for now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge
DESIGN	todo if object was an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two sql selects
DESIGN	todo put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second level cache needs some extra work
DESIGN	todo not quite sure about the full implications of this!
DESIGN	this is kind of the best we can do...
DESIGN	todo this need not exclude subclasses...
DESIGN	todo we use two visitors here inefficient!
DESIGN	trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cannot handle whitespaces before a in a sp
DESIGN	todo does this really need to be here? does the collection already have it is own up to date snapshot?
DESIGN	otherwise a trim specification and or a trim character have been specified we need to decide which options are present and do the right thing should leading trim characters be trimmed? should trailing trim characters be trimmed? the trim character the trim source
DESIGN	it is possible that the tree walking in outerjoinloader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known this temporary solution assumes that the property ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to a reasonable guess todo fix this add outerjoinloadable.getsubclasspropertytablename string propertyname
DESIGN	todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then return collection.getowner
DESIGN	i suppose?
DESIGN	tbd should this be varbinary 1 ? registercolumntype types.varbinary binary 1
DESIGN	shortcut
DESIGN	todo we should provide some way to get keys of collection of statistics to make it easier to retrieve from a gui perspective
DESIGN	todo probably better to calculate these and pass them in as it will be more performant
DESIGN	todo should we additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	todo simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
DESIGN	todo is there really any reason to kkeep trying if this fails once?
DESIGN	todo not sure this is correct could not find docs on how to do this.
DESIGN	hsql has no blob clob support .... but just put these here for now!
DESIGN	merges do not cascade to uninitialized collections todo perhaps this does need to cascade after all....
DESIGN	yick! need this for proper serialization deserialization handling...
DESIGN	todo should orphans really be deleted during lock???
DESIGN	todo move to stringhelper?
DESIGN	sets can be just a view of a part of another collection. do we need to copy it to be sure it will not be changing underneath us? ie. this.set.addall set
DESIGN	todo it would be really really nice to use this to also model components!
DESIGN	todo move to .sql package!!
DESIGN	todo look at the owning property and check that it is not lazy by instrumentation
DESIGN	todo add this info to the translator and aggregate it here...
DESIGN	todo possibly relax that
DESIGN	would be better to use the element type to determine whether the old and the new are equal here the problem being we do not necessarily have access to the element type in all cases
DESIGN	todo code duplication with joinedsubclassentitypersister
DESIGN	todo refactor to .sql package
DESIGN	todo two hashmap lookups here is one too many...
DESIGN	note that this method could easily be moved up to basicentitypersister if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
DESIGN	from the collection of associations locate oja for the manytoone corresponding to this persister to fully define the many to many we need that oja so that we can use its alias here todo is there a better way here?
DESIGN	todo this class depends directly upon criteriaimpl in the impl package ... add a criteriaimplementor interface
DESIGN	do we need to qualify index names with the schema name?
DESIGN	todo we probably should have a statisticsnotpublishedexception to make it clean
DESIGN	todo get sql rendering out of this package!
DESIGN	yukky! do not you have subclasses for that! todo race conditions can happen here
DESIGN	note very hackish workaround!! todo fix this so it will work for non pojo entity mode
DESIGN	todo need to make the majority of this functionality into a top level support class for custom impl support
DESIGN	for dom4j collections only todo it would be better if this was done at the higher level by printer
DESIGN	todo inefficient if that cache is just going to ignore the updated state!
DESIGN	todo an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then get the id from collection.getowner
DESIGN	todo refactor make this method private
DESIGN	todo keep seperate notions of qt here for shallow non shallow queries...
DESIGN	todo temporary needed because currently persister is the one that creates and renders the join fragments for inheritence hierarchies...
DESIGN	this is called by sessionfactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to sessionfactory to only conditionally call stop
DESIGN	swaldman 2004 02 07 modify to allow null values to signify fall through to c3p0 poolconfig defaults
DESIGN	work around that crazy issue where the tree contains empty fromelements no text afaict this is caused by fromelementfactory.createcollectionjoin
DESIGN	kind of ugly but needed for collections with a . node mapping
DESIGN	fixme get the persistentclass
DESIGN	todo would be great to have a mapping hasnonidentifierpropertynamedid method i do not believe that mapping getreferencedpropertytype accounts for the identifier property so if it returns for a property named id then we should have a non id field named id
DESIGN	entity name will not be available for non pojo entities todo cache the entity name somewhere so that it is available to this exception
DESIGN	todo is this really necessary????
DESIGN	index getpropertycolumnspan i todo this is kind of slow...
DESIGN	todo move to .sql package and refactor with similar things!
DESIGN	todo i am not so sure about the exception handling in this bit!
DESIGN	ugly little workaround for fact that createuniquekeyloaders does not handle component properties
DESIGN	append the sql to return the generated identifier todo suck into insert
DESIGN	this is really ugly but necessary
DESIGN	todo modify the class definition if not already transformed...
DESIGN	todo should we use select .. for update?
DESIGN	create an action that will evict collection and entity regions based on queryspaces table names . todo cache the autodetected information and pass it in instead.
DESIGN	todo is this 100 correct?
DESIGN	used only for regression testing!!!! todo obviously get rid of all this junk
DESIGN	note this assumes something about how propertyselectfragment is implemented by the subclass! was tounqotedaliasstrings getidentifercolumnnames before now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	use of a stringbuffer to workaround a jdk bug
DESIGN	todo move into collection type so we can use polymorphism!
DESIGN	todo should we just collect these like with the collections above?
DESIGN	todo should really move this log statement to collectiontype where this is used from...
DESIGN	fixme hacky workaround to jbcache 1202
DESIGN	hum ... should we cascade anyway? throw an exception? fine like it is?
DESIGN	todo this might really even be moved into the cfg package and used as the basis for all things which are configurable.
DESIGN	todo copy paste from insertrows
DESIGN	todo suck into event class
DESIGN	todo never reached since gettypename actually throws an exception!
DESIGN	this is used by sessionfactoryimpl to hand to the generated sessionimpl was the only reason i could see that we cannot just use null as settings.cacheprovider
DESIGN	xmlforest requires a new kind of function constructor
DESIGN	todo i considered validating the presence of the ts cache here but decided to defer unti getquerycacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
DESIGN	todo why not use the timestamp in a dataversion?
DESIGN	todo eventually merge this with treecache and just add optional opt lock support there.
DESIGN	fixme per the regionfactory class javadoc this constructor version should not be necessary. param props the configuration properties
DESIGN	todo i considered validating ts cache config here but decided to defer unti gettimestampscacheinstance in case the cache is never actually used
DESIGN	can happen because of the multiple ways cache.remove can be invoked
DESIGN	need to do that here rather than in the save event listener to let the post insert events to have a id filled entity when identity is used ejb3
DESIGN	unhappy about this being public ... is there a better way?
DESIGN	todo safe to interpret map.remove key null as non dirty?
DESIGN	fixme hack to work around fact that calling node added root.addchild fqn does not properly set the version on the node
DESIGN	work around the feature where tree cache is validating the inserted node during the next transaction. no idea...
DESIGN	todo is this a valid operation on a timestamps cache?
DESIGN	todo what else to do here?
DESIGN	todo replace this with a more elegant solution.
DESIGN	short cut check...
DESIGN	todo to handle concurrent writes correctly this should return a lock to the client
DESIGN	put has nowait semantics is this really appropriate? note that it needs to be async replication never local or sync
DESIGN	this is ugly here but needed because its a subquery
DESIGN	todo will need reference to session factory to fully complete hhh 1907
DESIGN	yuck!
DESIGN	inheritance cycle detection paranoid check
DESIGN	todo encapsulate the protected instance variables!
DESIGN	polymorphism comment above
DOCUMENTATION	todo find a decent name before documenting
IMPLEMENTATION	add an entry for this type of entity. we can be assured that all referenced entities have already been processed so specify that this entity is with the latest batch. doing the batch number before adding the name to the list is a faster way to get an accurate number.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle typedefs
IMPLEMENTATION	todo native ids
IMPLEMENTATION	todo bindpropertyresults alias returnelem
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle property ref
IMPLEMENTATION	todo validate existing of property with the chosen name. secondpass
IMPLEMENTATION	todo get all properties not just the fetched ones!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo restrict violation
IMPLEMENTATION	todo assertion only could be optimized away
IMPLEMENTATION	todo lowercasing done here. was done at random before maybe not needed at all ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo optimize away this lookup for entities w o unsaved value undefined
IMPLEMENTATION	todo tolowercase was not done before. only used in template.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo arithmetic expressions multiple new foo ...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check that entry.getidentifier .equals requestedid
IMPLEMENTATION	todo not visible to the user!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo can we limit stored procedures ?!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo formulas ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo use these in methods above
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache the persister this shows up in yourkit
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add referencedclass to disambiguate to fks on the same columns pointing to different tables
IMPLEMENTATION	todo create uk loaders for component properties
IMPLEMENTATION	todo still need to make collectionpersisters entitymode aware
IMPLEMENTATION	todo terrible implementation!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo eventually put this back in once we think all is fixed object otheralias columnsunique.put qualifiedcolumn columnalias
IMPLEMENTATION	todo i do not really like this implementation it would be better if this was handled by searchfordirtycollections
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if key contains the owner id
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache this in an instvar
IMPLEMENTATION	todo temporary initial step towards hhh 1907
IMPLEMENTATION	todo remove this once componentmetamodel is complete and merged
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add owner argument!!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle supportsnotnullunique false but such a case does not exist in the wild so far
IMPLEMENTATION	todo better error message since we actually support composites if names are explicitly listed.
IMPLEMENTATION	todo for some dialects it would be appropriate to add the renderorderbypropertiesselect to other select strings
IMPLEMENTATION	todo unnecessary for databases with ansi style joins
IMPLEMENTATION	todo maybe call it getrowselection ?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo make this handle multiple collection roles!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo include the rowids!!!!
IMPLEMENTATION	if we are still not resolved we might represent a constant. needed to add this here because the allowance of naked prop refs in the grammar collides with the definition of literals constants nondeterminism . todo cleanup the grammar so that processconstants is always just handled from here
IMPLEMENTATION	todo or should we return containstablealias ??
IMPLEMENTATION	todo look at perhaps caching this...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo avoid this for non new instances where mightbedirty false
IMPLEMENTATION	todo theoretically non threadsafe...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo look at optimizing these...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo cache this sql...
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check if mimer sql cannot handle the way db2 does
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if we are using identity columns fetch the identifier
IMPLEMENTATION	todo check there is no actual definition elemnents when a ref is defined
IMPLEMENTATION	table null an association fill it in later todo fill in the mappings for table null
IMPLEMENTATION	todo return new lock ts
IMPLEMENTATION	todo add support for read write nonstrict read write ???
IMPLEMENTATION	todo why are not these the same?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo proxies!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if we support multiple fetch groups we would need to clone the set of lazy properties!
IMPLEMENTATION	todo mappings.getlogicaltablename ownertable
IMPLEMENTATION	todo if lock.gettimestamp .equals ts
IMPLEMENTATION	todo always true for now but not if we later decide to support elements in the from clause
IMPLEMENTATION	we could move this inside if we wanted to tolerate collection initializations during collection dirty checking
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see if the user configured a multiplexer stack
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	root entity comes last
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	elementtype ??
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	scan the query string for class names appearing in the from clause and replace with all persistent implementors of the class interface returning multiple query strings make sure we do not pick up a class in the select clause!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	identifier collections not supported for 1 to many
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the current depth is 0 the root thing being loaded is the many to many collection itself. here it is alright to use an inner join...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	update removed rows fks to null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	registerfunction trim new standardsqlfunction trim hibernate.string
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	buf.append selectfragment lhsalias ignore suffix for collection columns!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize the set of queried identifier spaces ie. tables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use suffix for the entity columns
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we got here because we assumed that an instance with an assigned id was detached when it was really persistent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remove the current element from insertions. it will be added back later.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	private final string roottablename
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note this is being used from the process of shutting down a sessionfactory. specific things to consider 1 this clearing of the region should not propagate to other nodes on the cluster if any this is the cache mode local option bit... 2 really just trying a best effort to cleanup after ourselves lock failures etc are not critical here this is the fail silently option bit...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not null ... start with 1 is implicit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	continue loop

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use theta style for regression move the node up after the origin node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the main query
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlexception support
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the restriction to the outer select
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	bit length feels a bit broken to me. we have to cast to char in order to pass when a numeric value is supplied. but of course the answers given will be wildly different for these two datatypes. 1234.5678 will be 9 bytes as a char string but will be 8 or 16 bytes as a true numeric. jay nance 2006 09 22
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	skip the from keyword in params
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return a newly loaded object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make it circular reference safe
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	subclass closure properties
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for dialects which are known to not support ansi sql row value constructor syntax we should mutate the tree.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to hydrate it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	instantiate a new instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to upgrade the lock mode to the mode requested
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	look for a proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	features which change between 8i 9i and 10g
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	evicts do not cascade to uninitialized collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	features which remain constant across 8i 9i and 10g
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to treat this as if it where optimistic lock all dirty does not make sense first we need to locate the loaded state note it potentially could be a proxy so perform the location the safe way...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	column sc.gettable .getprimarykey .getcolumniterator .next .getname
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not need subclass tables because they cannot appear in conditions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	private list aliases new arraylist
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	register resolvers set via environment property
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an existing collection that was either non empty or uninitialized is replaced by null or a different collection if the collection is uninitialized hibernate has no way of knowing if the collection is actually empty without querying the db
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	update all the modified entries
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special case where we need to force incloude all subclass joins
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we did not find a collection element in the result set so we ensure that a collection is created with the owner s identifier since what we have is an empty collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	binary stream character stream
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	getdefaultproperties .setproperty environment.statement batch size no batch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hibernate impelemnts cast in dialect.java
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the root versioned table and we are using version based optimistic locking if we are not updating the version also do not check it unless this is a generated version column !
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	aggregate functions should not be registered right? registerfunction list new standardsqlfunction list hibernate.string stopped on list
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	its the given optional object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	decide which resultset to get the property value from
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise assume the parent is the the criteria that created us

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	required to exception table iconst 0 i
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for now just re flatten the metamodel since this is temporary stuff anyway hhh 1907
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checkcast cast the bean into a raw bean
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this one only really needed for badly behaved applications! if the transactionmanager has a sychronization registered its a noop actually we do need it for downgrading locks
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	checkcast case of primitive type invokevirtual case of primitive type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	at this point we have drivingsqlalias the sql alias of the driving table corresponding to the given user alias. however the driving table is not necessarily the table against which we want to apply locks. mainly the exception case here is joined subclass hierarchies where we instead want to apply the lock against the root table for all other strategies it just happens that driving and root are the same .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this bean args i raw bean exception
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the first child to be considered. sub classes may do this differently in order to skip nodes that are not select expressions e.g. distinct .

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the object is already loaded return the loaded one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create new lock that times out immediately
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	convenience methods relating to operations across arrays of types...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we really could refresh the item if it is not a lock but it might be slower return freshtimestamp txtimestamp
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	due to the complexity in initializing the selectclause do not generate one here. if it is not found simply return null... also do not cache since it gets generated well after we are created.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	versiontype impl note simply returns null for seed and next as the only known application of binary types for versioning is for use with the timestamp datatype supported by sybase and sql server which are completely db generated values...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	pre flushing section
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the lower case function name. remember whether we are in a select clause or not.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	upper is deprecated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	let this take precedence if defined since it works for assigned identifiers
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	throw new unsupportedoperationexception cannot write to a readonly object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the contract of entitytuplizer.determineconcretesubclassentityname says that returning null is an indication that the specified entity name this.getentityname should be used.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	according to both the ansi sql and ejb3 specs trim can either take exactly one parameter or a variable number of parameters between 1 and 4. from the sql spec trim function trim left paren trim operands right paren trim operands trim specification trim character from trim source trim specification leading trailing both if only trim specification is omitted both is assumed if trim character is omitted space is assumed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the syntax used to add a foreign key constraint to a table.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note it is conceptually possible that a usertype could map null to a non null value so the following is arguable
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	execute the sql
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note interfaces is assumed to already contain hibernateproxy.class
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assembled state gets put in a new array we read from cache by value!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not have to worry about queued additions to uninitialized collections since they can only occur for inverse collections!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	disassemble named parameters
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if not wrappered yet its dirty this cannot occur because we now always call wrap before getting to here return ! obj instanceof persistentcollection ? true searchfordirtycollections persistentcollection obj type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remove all collections for the entity from the session level cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invokeinterface callback.write ..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	joins
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this is an entity and the property is the identifier property then use getidentifiertype . note that the propertyname.equals propertypath checks whether we have a component key reference where the component class property name is the same as the entity id property name if the two are not equal this is the case and we would need to fall through to using the property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	classes mentioned in extends not available so put it in queue
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	propertytablenumbersbyname.put prop.getname join
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	needed to bump this up to dotnode because that is the only thing which currently knows about the property ref path in the correct format it is either this or recurse over the dotnodes constructing the property path just like dotnode does internally

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the name of the sql function that transforms a string to lowercase
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	null owner ok??
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	essentially if the real session is closed allow any method call to pass through since the real session will complain by throwing an appropriate exception note that allowing close above has the same basic effect but we capture that there simply to perform the unbind...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	automatically makes a column with the default name if none is specifed by xml
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is the exception returned by reflecthelper.getconstructor if it cannot locate an appropriate constructor
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ok in normal hibernate usage to delete a detached entity jpa however forbids it thus this is a hook for hem to affect this behavior

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	or should it actually throw an exception?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	both many to one and one to one are represented as a property. entitypersister is relying on this value to determine lazy fetch groups in terms of field level interception. so we need to make sure that we return true here for the case of many to one and one to one with lazy no proxy impl note lazy no proxy currently forces both lazy and unwrap to be set to true. the other case we are extremely interested in here is that of lazy proxy where lazy is set to true but unwrap is set to false. thus we use both here under the assumption that this return is really only ever used during persister construction to determine the lazy property field fetch groupings. if that assertion changes then this check needs to change as well. partially this is an issue with the overloading of the term lazy here...

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	need to parse off the column qualifiers this is assuming which is true as of now that this is only used from update and delete hql statement parsing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the current join represents the join between a many to many association table and its target table. here we need to apply any additional filters defined specifically on the many to many

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check basic level one nullablilty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add a zero or quite low timeout option so we do not block. ignore any timeoutexception. basically we forego caching the query result in order to avoid blocking. reads are done with suspended tx so they should not hold the lock for long. not caching the query result is ok since any subsequent read will just see the old result with its out of date timestamp that result will be discarded and the db query performed again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	values is not null and is checkable we will look deeper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	possibly handle something parameters for the query ?

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	registercolumntype types.varchar 16777215 mediumtext
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ident might be the name of a class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we do not want to suspend the tx. if we do 1 we might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes. no tx no wl on cache node so other threads can prematurely see those query results 2 no tx immediate replication. more overhead plus we spread issue 1 above around the cluster
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	todo!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for regression testing against output from the old parser... found it easiest to simply reorder the fromelements here into ascending order in terms of injecting them into the resulting sql ast in orders relative to those expected by the old parser this is definitely another of those only needed for regression purposes . the syntheticandfactory then simply injects them as it encounters them.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	give the interceptor a chance to modify property values
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we might need to recalculate the dirtyproperties array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the current version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	object loaded by update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore this row the collection is in process of being loaded somewhere further up the stack
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	entity load contexts currently not yet used...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	dirty check against the usual snapshot of the entity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this implementation is supposed to tolerate incorrect unsaved value mappings for the purpose of backward compatibility
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	wrap up any new collections directly referenced by the object or its components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	skip this check for composite ids relating to dom4j entity mode alternatively we could add a check to make sure the incoming id value is an instance of element...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	upgrade the lock if necessary lock result lockmode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now any collections that are initialized inside this block do not get updated they are ignored until the next flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not ne a b eq a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we must clone embedded composite identifiers or we will get back the same instance that we pass in
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sub insertions should occur before containing insertion so try to do the callback now
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not le a b gt a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not ge a b lt a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not lt a b ge a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the entity is not associated with the session so try interceptor and unsaved value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	... and the expected token type was an identifier then
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	igndore it...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	jsd the fix for hhh 558...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the token can tell us if it could be an identifier...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are now at a new tree level
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	dirty check against the database snapshot if possible necessary
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the interceptor handled the dirty checking
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	column simplevalue ic.getindex .getcolumniterator .next .setnullable false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	60 seconds
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	evict operations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the id from the object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do the put outside the scope of the jta txn
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	what is the version on the database?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hhh 2378
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will result in a sql update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	else do nothing do not even reassociate object!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no existing row do an insert
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inner classes moved here from sql gen.g
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should be the first but just to be safe...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return a proxy if appropriate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some filters affecting the collection are enabled on the session so do not do the put into the cache.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate an explicit join for the root dot node. the implied joins will be collected and passed up to the root dot node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a session is considered to contain an entity only if the entity has an entry in the session s persistence context and the entry reports that the entity has not been removed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	... and the token could be an identifer and the error is a mismatched token error ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if a where clause was specified in the update delete query use it to limit the returned ids here...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	default implementation if this node has a data type and that data type is not an association then this is scalar.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resolve the lhs fully generate implicit joins. pass in the property name so that the resolver can discover foreign key id properties.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the propertytype is null and there is not a parent just stop now... there was a problem resolving the node anyway.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not look for an existing join on the same path because it makes sense to join twice on the same collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return new uninitialized proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this object was already loaded
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	entity was found in second level cache...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	intializes result by side effect
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note max 1 because first is zero based while max is not...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a shallow query is ok although technically there should be no fetching here...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remember the parameters for the compilation.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	package local methods for the queryloader delegate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now done in entityidentityinsertaction persister.setidentifier entity id source.getentitymode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the token as an identifier.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some statistics
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	safe from concurrent modification because of how entrylist is implemented on identitymap
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	transform the tree.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	parse the query string into an hql ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	so this needs to be safe from concurrent modification problems. it is safe because of how identitymap implements entryset
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only needed during compilation phase...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	update the status of the object and if necessary schedule an update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	schedule updates to collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity inserts updates in order to account for bidi associations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database has changed now so the subselect results need to be invalidated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the collection is dereferenced remove from the session cache iter.remove does not work since the entryset is not backed by the set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 1 parse the hql into an ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	key is an entity involved with the operation performed by the listener value is a flag indicating if the listener explicitly operates on the entity
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get a snapshot
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	public final currency getcurrency int col throws hibernateexception return currency get col
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	right represents a joins originating from left...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the query is already compiled skip the compilation.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remember that ordinal parameters numbers are 1 based!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	overriden to avoid system.exit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	all clear
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore the token class name parameter and use a specific token class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	early exit!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before any callbacks etc so subdeletions see that this deletion happened first
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ensures that containing deletions happen before sub deletions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade delete to collections before the collection owner is deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade delete to many to one after the parent was deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is an initialized proxy let cascade handle it later on
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assign the requested id to the proxy before reassociating the proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an uninitialized proxy noop do not even need to return an id since it is never a save
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize properties of the event
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the id in the event object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	transient or deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume this is a newly instantiated transient object which should be saved rather than updated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a transient object with existing persistent state not loaded by the session
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check two adjecent nodes at the top of the from clause tree
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cachedstate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a detached collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the collection belonged to a different entity clean up the existing state of the collection
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	log.debug calling onload
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note performexecutions clears all collectionxxxxtion collections the collection actions in the session
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. the entity came in from update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to check even if it was not initialized because of delayed adds!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if template is null we just write the function out as it appears in the hql statement
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	semantic action processing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find any entities that are still transient after retry
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize sql nodes here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check the persistence context for an entry relating to this entity to be merged...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the unresolved path in this node and the parent. set the text for the parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	60 second lock timeout
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	property prop new property prop.setname id prop.setpropertyaccessorname embedded prop.setvalue id entity.setidentifierproperty prop
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	continue... we will find out if it ends up not getting saved later
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that entity id requestedid
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not a collection? return the entity property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection of many to any mappings... used to circumvent the component collection check below...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise the destination node was implied by the from clause and the from clause processor will automatically add it in the right place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the first identifier in the path referrs to the class alias not the class name then this is a correlated subselect. if it is a correlated sub select use the existing table alias. otherwise generate a new one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	origin.adddestination destination add the query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reset the node type because the rest of the system is expecting from fragment all we wanted was for the factory to create the right sub class. this might get reset again later on anyway to make the sql generation simpler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	explicit true this is an explict select. arraylist sqlresulttypelist new arraylist
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlresulttypelist.add type generate the select expression.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the expression list has exactly one expression and the type of the expression is a collection then this might be a collection function such as index c or size c .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the uber rule here is that we need to include subclass joins if the fromelement is in any way dereferenced by a property from the subclass table otherwise we end up with column references qualified by a non existent table reference in the resulting sql...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before cascade!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade first so that all unsaved objects get their copy created before we actually copy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	copyvalues works by reflection so explicitly mark the entity instance dirty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression in the list of nested subexpressions we are currently processing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no need to even collect this information if the persister is considered multi table
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as soon as we encounter our first letter return the substring from that position
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	retrieve the value of the designated column in the current row of this resultset object as a java.io.reader object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays replaceelements may return a different reference since the array length might not match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not be able to reach last without maxposition being set unless there are no results
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not use proxiesbykey since not all proxies that point to this session s instances are in that collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should be a call to resolve not resolveidentifier cos it might be a property ref and we did not cache the referenced value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we have tt not found ignore tt association mapped to a formula we always need to dirty check it so we can update the second level cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we now have the value of the property ref we reference. however we need to dig a little deeper as that property might also be an entity type in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	true if this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role otherwise this is a collectioninitializer and we are loading up a single collection or batch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this method should be implemented assuming it is valid to do start stop start leave state appropriate for another start
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not want to waste effort setting an option if jbc is already in local mode. if jbc is repl a sync then check if they passed an config option to disable query replication
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	see if we had a 2nd invalidation from the same initial preinvalidation timestamp. if so only increment if the new current value is an increase
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the workspace node has null as well ok if not we have been modified in a non comparable manner which we have to treat as us being newer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	maintain correct duplication if loaded in a cartesian product
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	datasource unpooled datasources.unpooleddatasource jdbcurl props.getproperty environment.user props.getproperty environment.pass
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not need to lock the cache here since if someone else inserted the same pk first the insert would fail
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to grab the version value from the entity otherwise we have issues with generated version entities that may have multiple actions queued during the same flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	short circuit s no new elements the old list contains only orphans no old elements so no orphans neither
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test out the optimizer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the updated snapshot of the entity state by cloning current state it is safe to copy in place since by this time no one else should have has a reference to the array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	!persister.iscacheinvalidationrequired
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the existing pool flag to true
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have created the pool ourselves so shut it down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the load which takes an entity does not pass an entityname
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note expected in the syntax type listenerclass sep type listenerclass where sep is any whitespace or comma
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tree cache in optimistic mode seems to have as very difficult time with remove calls on non existent nodes npes ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we ignore minimalputoverride. jbosscache putforexternalread is already about as minimal as we can get it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing for persistent instances
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimisticcache impl
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	option.setdataversion nonlockingdataversion.instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume true since we do not really know and it does not matter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	show the modified ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize dirty flags for arrays collections with composite elements and reset reached doupdate etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the dot node about the join type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this dot expression now refers to the resulting from element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	among other things updatereachables will recursively load all collections that are moving roles. this might because entities to be loaded.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	post flushing section
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise recreate the mapping between the collection and its key
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create a parameter specification for the collection filter...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	attach any mapping defined order by fragments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we found some extends attributes referencing entities which were not already processed. here we need to locate all entity names and class names contained in this document itself making sure that these get removed from the extendz list such that only extends names which require us to delay processing i.e. external to this document and not yet processed are contained in the returned result
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure that the persister is versioned
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for native sql queries the param metadata is determined outside any relation to a query plan because query plan creation and or retreival for a native sql query depends on all of the return types having been set which might not be the case up front when param metadata would be most useful
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this function has a template redirect output and catch the arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the id assigned to the instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no array holder we found an unwrappered array this cannot occur because we now always call wrap before getting to here return ah null ? true searchfordirtycollections ah type
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the data type is not an association type it could not have been in the from clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to generate ids as part of this bulk insert. note that this is only supported for sequence style generators and post insert style generators basically only in db generators
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first look for a reference to a projection alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there are no collection fetches then no further checks are needed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	commented out by inspection 12 11 04 10 56 am int getwarningcount
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if a threadlocalsessioncontext bound session happens to get serialized to be completely correct we need to make sure that unbinding of that session occurs.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure no alias is applied to the table name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	delegate to the queryloader...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not actually propogate antlrexceptions as a because so log it here for diagnostic purposes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the explicitly declared select expression determine the return types indicated by each select token
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	select clauses for insert statements should alwasy be treated as shallow
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	after that process the joins. invoke a delegate to do the work as this is farily complex.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cache impl
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	simple cache of param metadata based on query string. ideally the original user supplied query string should be used to retreive this metadata i.e. not the para list expanded query string to avoid unnecessary cache entries. used solely for caching param metadata for native sql queries see getsqlparametermetadata for a discussion as to why...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	alias references and identifiers use the same node class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	these are just two unrelated table references
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again both should be fromelements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check a set of parent child nodes in the from clause tree to determine if a comma is required between them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 2 analyze the hql ast and produce an sql ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	phase 3 generate the sql.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise we have a non scalar select with defined collection fetch es . make sure that there is only a single root entity in the return no tuples
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	paramtranslations new parametertranslationsimpl collectedparameterspecifications
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are already processing a dot structure
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should mean that no such property was found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	was there an explicit select expression?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resolve everything up to this dot but do not resolve the placeholders yet.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not not between a b between a b
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just add a not parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first save off the pertinent ids as the return value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if the connection is in auto commit mode no connection means aggressive connection release outside a jta transaction context so must be autocommit mode
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first save off the pertinent ids saving the number of pertinent ids for return
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	start performing the deletes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not forget to resolve the argument! resolve the collection function now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise everything ok.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	re arrange the tree so that the collection function is the root and the lhs is the path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected regionrootlistener listener
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inject the where after the parent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	never include subclasses for implied from elements.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	establish the region root node with a non locking data version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for pessimistic locking we just want to toss out our ref to any old invalid root node and get the latest may be null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the rest only matters for optimistic locking where we need to establish the proper data version on the region root
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if this dot has already been resolved stop now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the property is another class..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise this is a primitive type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	foo.bars.size also handles deprecated stuff like foo.bars.maxelement for backwardness
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for timestamps we default to a separate config
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	optimistic lock all include all updatable properties optimistic lock dirty include all properties we are updating this time
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this property belongs to the table and it is not specifically excluded from optimistic locking by optimistic lock false
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	information about properties of this class including inherited properties only really needed for updatable insertable properties
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated. for partial component generation we currently just re select the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note addduplicatealias already performs nullness checks on the alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the from clauses are the same we can be a little more aggressive in terms of what we reuse
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again null ! null here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise subquery case do not reuse the fromelement if we are processing the from clause of the subquery
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the lhs hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the referenced node text is the special id
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only the identifier property field name can be a reference to the associated entity s pk...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special shortcut for id properties skip the join! this must only occur at the end of a path expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	append the new property name onto the unresolved path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the destination fromelement to includesubclasses .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the lhs is a collection use collectionpropertymapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not resolve the node again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	lists arrays sets maps bags
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have something like ? op rhs
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	configure the cache to use our tm
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure jbc does not look one up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we finish all the removes first to take care of possible unique constraints and so that we can take better advantage of batching
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a combination of foreign key columns and pk columns since the ordering of removal and addition is not guaranteed when a child moves from one parent to another
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure we do not re release the same cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we use a different delegate than the non optimistic superclass default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we have something like lhs op ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not create a unique key cos some databases do not like a uk on nullable columns getcollectiontable .createuniquekey getidentifier .getconstraintcolumns
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isset collection.isset issorted collection.issorted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the rhs hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if jbc is using invalidation we do not want to propagate changes. we use the timestamps cache to manage invalidation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not hold the jbc node lock throughout the tx as that prevents updates add a zero or low timeout option so we do not block waiting for tx s that did a put to commit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	double check the distributed cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get an exclusive right to update jbc for this key from this node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one or the other needs to be a datetime for us to get into this method in the first place...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add the condition to the join sequence that qualifies the indexed element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sometimes use the element table alias sometimes use the... umm... collection table alias many to many
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now set the text for this node. it should be the element columns.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the function return value type based on the type of the first argument.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this will call initialize tok !
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	mutation depends on the types of nodes invloved...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generated select expressions are already resolved nothing to do.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the path may be a reference to an alias defined in the parent query.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the hql class alias refers to the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	associate the table alias with the element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	try the parent fromclause...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure that all from elements registered with this from clause are actually in the ast.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	invoke setscalarcolumntext on each constructor argument.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collect the select expressions skip the first child because it is the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return an empty type array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there is no order by make one

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	find the where if there is no where find the from...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now inject the newly built order by into the tree
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	logic operators by definition resolve to boolean.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	render the identifier select fragment using the table alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	class names in the from clause result in a joinsequence the old fromparser does this .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will still be issued when it used to be null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise use the property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we ensure async semantics jbcache 1175
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the standard comparator types are not serializable but are singletons
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	generate implicit joins only if necessary.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the property is a special collection property name return a collectionpropertymapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection of components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	local cache so we use synchronization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to seed the version value as part of this bulk insert
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	make sure the lhs is assignable ...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	false indicates to not generate parens around the assignment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	currently allowed...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in non select queries the only time we should need to join is if we are in a subquery from clause
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return classalias null ? classname classalias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is an explicit from element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	swaldman 2006 08 28 define c3p0 style configuration parameters for initialpoolsize which hibernate sensibly let us default to minpoolsize but we will let users override it with the c3p0 style property if they want.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	fetch cannot be used with scroll or iterate .
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is not implied or it is implied and it is a many to many join where the target was not found.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to wrtap the param in a cast
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since this is an explicit from element it cannot be implied in the from clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing eplicit from elements are always in the projection list.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	propertyname refers to something like collection.size...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	property name is a sub path of a component...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	always add the collection s query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	nothing to do even if the operand is a parameter no way we could infer an appropriate expected type here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	notify the from element that it is being referenced by the select.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	early exit!!! return so the resolve call explicitly coming from dotnode can resolve this...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume this ident s text does not refer to a property on the given persister
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just ignore it for now it will get resolved later...
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is not actually a constant but a reference to from element.
