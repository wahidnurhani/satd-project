DEFECT	bug 124306 we should rely on xmlcalendar to normalize dave value to ensure that all date value fields are taken into account.
DEFECT	fb will not compile with vaj or no jikes fb object adapter adapterfactory.adapt mapping
DEFECT	eatm must fix isset bits.
DEFECT	is this an error???
DEFECT	line comments at the end of annotations are not a part of the range of annotation todo is not including line comments at the end of annotations a bug?
DEFECT	eatm in jdk 1.4 there will be an indexof on stringbuffer.
DESIGN	eatm call the deprecated method which does the same thing but might have an override in older code.
DESIGN	todo factor up into genbaseimpl
DESIGN	todo deprecate since getpluginclass is no longer called
DESIGN	ensure that this race condition is thread safe it does not matter who wins the race.
DESIGN	todo factor up into genbaseimpl?
DESIGN	todo this assumes we only get a set notification which is not a good assumption.
DESIGN	dms handle this well.
DESIGN	unused?
DESIGN	fb tbd can we come up with a better algorithm for choosing the default label feature?
DESIGN	dms what if eclipse is running but an invalid facade has been specified? we still should format code use encoding ...
DESIGN	dms do a better job with specific exceptions? just use chained runtimeexceptions?
DESIGN	if the delegate uri can be handled as a file we will hope that renaming it will be really efficient.
DESIGN	assume that it is an attribute for now. it will could become a reference if the type resolves to an eclass.
DESIGN	do nothing for now and avoid propagating the exception. how should builders handle cancel?
DESIGN	this is a fall back however this should never be called
DESIGN	todo fix the space above
DESIGN	todo remove this bogus empty line
DESIGN	todo handle class cast exception better.
DESIGN	i do not know if we should be run this deferred because we might have to give the editor a chance to process the viewer update events and hence to update the views first.
DESIGN	this is a big festering hack to make the images the right size from the start.
DESIGN	eatm demand create metadata needs to depend on processing mode...
DESIGN	tbd return user selected subset? of referenced packages that contain super classes of classes in this package.
DESIGN	call the workaround
DESIGN	tbd rethink where exactly some of the following methods belong genmodel or genpackage
DESIGN	eatm this would be wrong.
DESIGN	call workaround
DESIGN	the label is not used.
DESIGN	motif kludge we would get something random instead of null.
DESIGN	todo so what should be the etype be now?
DESIGN	eatm kind of hacky.
DESIGN	this runs the operation and shows progress. it appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread.
DESIGN	this is a kludge to deal with enumerators which crash the doswitch.
DESIGN	this is copied from itemprovideradapterfactory.
DESIGN	eatm this might be better written as a single loop for the eobject case?
DESIGN	dms why not this? new subprogressmonitor progressmonitor 1
DESIGN	second alternative should be getmodelproject ?
DESIGN	todo this is really quite attrocious since there is code that will assume an iterator that returns strings!
DESIGN	todo hack that should be removed.
DESIGN	todo specialize this to return a resource locator for messages specific to this validator. ensure that you remove generated or mark it generated not
DESIGN	todo I am concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403. so should we consider something to exist even though access if unauthorized or forbidden?
DESIGN	only file scheme uris will be re encoded. if a uri was decoded in the workaround above and platform.resolve did not return a file scheme uri then this will return an decoded uri.
DESIGN	this functionality should eventually go away as it is replaced by model exporters. we will just delegate to the deprecated genpackage method. the monitor is not used so we will not pass it.
DESIGN	the eannotations and egenerictype are possible containment references. we will move them instead of copying
DESIGN	temporary structure to hold node s attributes namespaces in scope
DESIGN	hack reading encoding
DESIGN	because of the old factoring approach in the create method it might be the case that the state of the old value has changed by the time we get here and in that case we do not want to duplicate the removals in this code.
DESIGN	todo this is faster than many charat calls.
DESIGN	revisit remove this code.
DESIGN	revisit do we really need to support block names as in unicode 3.1 or we can just create all the names in isblockname format xml schema rec ?
DESIGN	note registry based authority is being removed from a new spec for uri which would obsolete rfc 2396. if the spec is added to xml errata processing of reg name needs to be removed. mrglavas.
DESIGN	revisit remove this code. store port value as string instead of integer.
DESIGN	bubble sort why? in many cases this.ranges has few elements.
DESIGN	per schema 1.0 it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid uri. for the future if we plant to support iris then it is better not to massage the initialvalue. we should thought consider where would be the best way to validate anyuri values el
DESIGN	note that the way they are sorted the values of index i always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list. eatm todo we could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result.
DESIGN	todo deprecate since no longer used by geteditpluginclass geteditorpluginclass gettestsuiteclass
DESIGN	if there are multiple variables in declaration separate this variable fragment into a separate declaration
DESIGN	dms should we let this exception out?
DESIGN	dms factor this into a method? use a non static subclass?
DESIGN	dms this does not really produce nice output.
IMPLEMENTATION	fb tbd filter out volatile and other inappropriate links?
IMPLEMENTATION	todo processing instructions are not sent to recordvalues

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since input objects are read only we do not need to make a copy of them for the clipboard. we can just put a pointer to the original object s on the clipboard.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	many inherited methods must be overridden to handle this case.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	since we only use this right on an operation we always want to include the keytype and valuetype and we never want to qualify the property names.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there are any arguments and they are not unbounded wildcards casts cannot be checked.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	remove any menu items for old selection.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	force an update because eclipse hides empty menus now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to be conservative and diagnose a problem only if we are quite sure that type is built in and hence that the lack of a default value really represents a problem with being unable to convert the literal to a value.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this just notifies those things that are affected by the section.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not even consider it unless this is hierarchical and has scheme authority device and path absoluteness equal to those of the prefix.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the prefix has no segments then it is the root absolute path and we know this is an absolute path too.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	stop listening to the old one.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	barring a better result this will be the result.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	creates the model from the editor input
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the prefix really is a prefix of this. if this has just one more empty segment the paths are the same.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only creates the other pages if there is something that can be edited
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do this here because getextendedmetadata is used during initialization and the mappings are are populated the first time it is fetched which will miss the packages we add as we initialize the tree.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	create package meta data objects
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	encodes the given string replacing each ascii character that is not in the set specified by the 128 bit bitmask and each non ascii character below 0xa0 by an escape sequence of followed by two hex digits. if is not in the set but ignoreescaped is true then will not be encoded iff it already begins a valid escape sequence.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tests whether an escape occurs in the given string starting at index i. an escape sequence is a followed by two hex digits.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	multiple jet directives.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there is no reason they are not equal so they are.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the set states are the same and the values of the feature are the structurally equal they are equal.
