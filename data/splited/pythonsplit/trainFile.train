DEFECT	* TODO error counting needs to be sorted out. * * At present the Statistical Sampler tracks errors separately * It would make sense to move the error count here but this would * mean lots of changes. * it is also tricky maintaining the count - it cannot just be incremented/decremented * when the success flag is set as this may be done multiple times. * The work-round for now is to do the work in the StatisticalSampleResult * which overrides this method. * Note that some JMS samplers also create samples with > 1 sample count * Also the Transaction Controller probably needs to be changed to do * proper sample and error accounting. * The purpose of this work-round is to allow at least minimal support for * errors in remote statistical batch mode. *

But for the time being I just prefer to be aware of any problems occuring here most likely programming errors so I will bail out. (MS Note) cannot bail out - newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults.

DESIGN	TODO should equals and hashCode depend on field other than count?
DESIGN	TODO Does this method need to be public? It is not currently called outside of this class.
DESIGN	TODO Should the method signature of this method be changed to match the super-implementation (using a TestElement parameter instead of AbstractListenerElement)? This would require an instanceof check before adding the listener (below) but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for sub-classes -- the Java rules dealing with this situation are not always intuitive and a subclass may think it is calling this version of the method when it is really calling the superclass version instead.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Note that sampleStarted() and sampleStopped() is not made to appear in synch with sampleOccured() when replaying held samples. For now this is not critical since sampleStarted() and sampleStopped() is not used but it may become an issue in the future. Then these events must also be stored so that replay of all events may occur and in the right order. Each stored event must then be tagged with something that let us you distinguish between occured started and ended.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	An additional note on using HashSets to store URLs I just discovered that obtaining the hashCode of a java.net.URL implies a domain-name resolution process. This means significant delays can occur even more so if the domain name is not resolvable. Whether this can be a problem in practical situations I cannot tell but thought I would keep a note just in case BTW note that using a List and removing duplicates via scan would not help since URL.equals requires name resolution too. The above problem has now been addressed with the URLString and URLCollection classes.

DESIGN	TODO we really want to be able replace the initial content handler which is passed to SAX but we cannot do this without cloning a whole bunch of code because it is private in the super class.
DESIGN	If no Fig was created by the code above then we must go look for the old style constructor that should have fallen into disuse by now. Fig(Object Rectangle DiagramSettings) All of these constructors should have been deprecated at least and replaced with the new signature. This is here for paranoia only until all Figs have been reviewed.
DESIGN	A FigNodeModelElement with no owner should match here TODO This is a temporary solution due to FigPool extending FigNodeModelElement when in fact it should not do so.
DESIGN	"* * Translate the visibility flag of a Fig to the PGML ""visibility"" attribute * value. * The PGML values are 0=hidden and 1=shown. * If not specified then 1 is the default so we return null for this to * prevent redundent data being written to PGML. * TODO Remove on GEF release after 0.11.9 as it will be provided there. * * @param f The Fig * @return ""0""=hidden null=shown"

DESIGN	TODO split into one critic for inherited problems and one for problems directly in this class.
DESIGN	TODO Do we need this Generalization is not a named element
DESIGN	These may not actually make any difference at present (the code behind addTrigger needs more work).

DESIGN	* * Gets font name. If it does not exist in configuration it creates new * entries in configuration for appearance. * * TODO Why create in a getter? * * @return the name of the configured font
DESIGN	TODO What is this trying to do? it is never going to get called - tfm really dirty hack to remove unwanted listeners
DESIGN	TODO This should not be referencing the current project. Instead the appropriate UndoManager should have already been retrieved from the correct project.
DESIGN	TODO we should be given an Undo manager to use rather than looking for a global one
DESIGN	TODO Replace the next deprecated call. This case is complicated * by the use of parameters. All other Figs work differently.
DESIGN	* * Class to display graphics for a UML Choice State in a diagram - the circle. * * TODO This should really be renamed FigChoiceState. it is the * last vestige of the UML 1.3 name. * * @author pepargouml

DESIGN	The next 4 lines fix the 2nd half of issue 5638. * Is there no better way?
DESIGN	* * Return a list of gravity points around circle which is enclosed * in the bounding box. Convenience method for use by FigInitialState * and FigFinalState. * TODO As this method is not required by all sub classes * it would seem sensible to extend FigStateVertex with FigCircleVertex * and only have the relevant concrete Figs extend that and gain this * functionality. * @return a List of Points
DESIGN	* * To resize only when a new concurrent region is added * changing the height. * TODO Probably should not * exist as this class should be listening for added concurrent regions * and call this internally itself. * * @param h the new height
DESIGN	TODO are not our items always strings? - tfm 20100917
DESIGN	* * Actually instanciate the NetNode and FigNode objects and * set the global next mode to ModePlace * TODO should call super reduce code volume! * * @see org.tigris.gef.graph.GraphFactorymakeNode()
DESIGN	TODO This logic may well be worth moving into the model component. Provide a similar grid to the connectionsGrid
DESIGN	TODO ? if this class listen the model it will be able to change in live as it is done in the figs (diagram)
DESIGN	TODO Redo it (curBody should be as long as curLanguage+button)
DESIGN	TODO Needs to be tidied up after stable release. Graph model should be created in constructor
DESIGN	* * When we change the type we need to create a new Initial Value. And * to display the Panel * * TODO if we select the same type that the current do nothing.
DESIGN	TODO We definitely do not want to react to addition and removal of transitions. cannot we be more specific when we register ourselves as a listener.
DESIGN	* * The target model element * In UML1.x this is the element that owns the expression. * In UML2.x this is the expression itself * TODO This makes behaviour different enough that separate subclasses * should be considered.
DESIGN	* * Field TODO TextArea or TextField
DESIGN	* * TODO Use it notify Set to true to forward events to model. Only one of * Language and Body fields should have this set to true.
DESIGN	TODO If this is an ordered list then you have to add in the right location!
DESIGN	TODO This is a redundant invocation
DESIGN	Get all classifiers in our model TODO We need the property panels to have some reference to the project they belong to instead of using deprecated functionality
DESIGN	* * TODO Copied from UmlDiagramRenderer. * * Get the FigNode from the given layer that represents the given * model element. * The FigNode portion of an association class is returned in preference * to the FigEdge portion. * If no FigNode is found then a FIgEdge is searched for and the FigNode * that acts as its edge port is returned. * @param lay the layer containing the Fig * @param modelElement the model element to find presentation for * @return the FigNode presentation of the model element
DESIGN	TODO build a return parameter
DESIGN	TODO how to merge multiple inheritance? Necessary? This currently copies the common ancestors multiple times
DESIGN	TODO This cannot depend on ProjectBrowser. Alternate below
DESIGN	TODO This is a composite association so these will get deleted automatically. The only thing we need to do is check for any additional elements that need to be deleted as a result.
DESIGN	TODO This is well-formedness rule from UML1.4.2 4.5.3.20 [2] No GeneralizableElement can have a parent Generalization to an element that is a leaf. self.parent->forAll(s | not s.isLeaf)
DESIGN	Check arguments against parameters for type and number TODO Perhaps move this to a critic instead? - tfm - 20070326
DESIGN	TODO Add standard stereotype? Set is open ended but predefined names include call create instantiate send
DESIGN	TODO Is there anyway we can determine this size at runtime?
DESIGN	* * We are getting events we do not want. Filter them out. * TODO Can we instruct the model event pump not to send these in the * first place? See defect 5095. * @param event the event
DESIGN	* modelImpl.getFacade().getRootElements() gets all root elements * in the UML repository including available profiles that are not * part of the current project (degrades performance). * * ProjectManager.getManager().getCurrentProject().getRoots() only * returns user model roots and no profiles. * * ProjectManager.getManager().getCurrentProject().getModels() gets * all root models but no root namespaces. * * TODO Which is best? Is there any other way?
DESIGN	* TODO As currently coded this actually returns all BehavioralFeatures * which are owned by Classifiers contained in the given namespace which * is slightly different then what is documented. It will not include any * BehavioralFeatures which are part of the Namespace but which do not have * an owner.
DESIGN	TODO Performance. Consider instantiating this just once outside the for loops and clear at this point instead.
DESIGN	* Delete a model element. Implements 'cascading delete' to make sure * model is still valid after element has been deleted. * * The actual deletion is delegated to delete methods in the rest of the * factories. For example a method deleteClass exists on CoreHelper. Delete * methods as deleteClass should only do those extra actions that are * necessary for the deletion of the modelelement itself. I.e. deleteClass * should only take care of things specific to UmlClass. * * The delete methods in the UML Factories should not be called directly * throughout the code! Calls should always refer to this method and never * call the deleteXXX method on XXXFactory directly. The reason that it is * possible to call the deleteXXX methods directly is a pure implementation * detail. * * The implementation of this method uses a quite complicated if/then/else * tree. This is done to provide optimal performance and full compliance to * the UML 1.4 metamodel. The last remark refers to the fact that the * UML 1.4 model uses multiple inheritance in several places. * This has to be taken into account. * * TODO The requirements of the metamodel could probably be better * determined by reflection on the metamodel. Then each association * that a deleted element participates in could be reviewed to make sure * that it meets the requirements and if not be deleted. - tfm * * Extensions and its children are not taken into account here. They do not * require extra cleanup actions. Not in the form of a call to the remove * method as is normal for all children of MBase and not in the form of * other behaviour we want to implement via this operation. * * @param elem * The element to be deleted * * @see org.argouml.model.UmlFactorydelete(java.lang.Object)
DESIGN	do not allow connections to be created from a read only model element to any other TODO This should be considered a workaround. It only works because by default we place newly created relationships in the namespace of the fromElement. The correct behavior in the presence of read-only elements really depends on the type of connection as well as the writeability of both ends.
DESIGN	TODO Taken from FigClassifierBoxWithAttribute to handle events on an attribute. All this event handling should eventually be moved to the compartment Fig for attributes
DESIGN	"* * An array of valid connections the combination of connecting class and * node classes must exist as a row in this list to be considered valid. * * The 1st column is the connecting element. * The 2nd column is the ""from"" element type. * The 3rd column is the ""to"" element type. * The 3rd column is optional if not given then it is assumed to be * the same as the ""from"" element. * The existence of a 4th column indicates that the connection is valid * in one direction only. * * TODO This encodes not only what is legal in UML but also what ArgoUML * knows how to create so not all legal connections are included. Probably * should be split into two pieces 1) legal UML (here) and 2) supported (in * ArgoUML application someplace) - tfm - 20060325 * See also issue 3863. * * Most of these are subtypes of Relationship which includes Association * Dependency Flow Generalization Extend and Include. Dependency * includes Binding Abstraction Usage and Permission. AssociationRole and * AssociationClass are Associations. The remaining items (Link Transition * AssociationEnd Message) are non-Relationship types which ArgoUML treats * as connections/edges."
DESIGN	TODO check for duplicates (is this possible???)
DESIGN	"TODO We also have code registering for the names of a tagged value like ""derived"""
DESIGN	* * Recursive method to get all subtypes. * * TODO Does this have a scalability problem?
DESIGN	TODO Bob says - we should not be listening here for addition and removal of attributes. This should be done in FigAttributesCompartment.
DESIGN	do not wait on ourselves we will deadlock! TODO We might want to throw an exception here
DESIGN	TODO Must we calculate the whole list?
DESIGN	TODO replace this recursive function by a loop like in getRoot
DESIGN	* * Updates a compartment box. Called from updateLayout if there is * a model event effecting the attributes/operations and from * renderingChanged in all cases. * TODO The above statement means that the entire contents of the * compartments are being rebuilt whenever an add/remove * of an attribute operation or a reception is detected. It would be * better to have compartments listen for add and remove events * and make minimum change rather than entirely rebuild. * Remark MVW This is a bit exaggerated since the populate() * method is already heavily optimized.
DESIGN	TODO Reconfigure exception handling to distinguish between errors that are possible due to bad input data and those that represent unexpected processing errors.
DESIGN	TODO Callers will need to be refactored to work around the change in the way multiplicities work - tfm
DESIGN	and its stereotypes TODO are not stereotypes handled elsewhere?
DESIGN	TODO Because we get called on each and every change event when the model is in a state of flux we will often get an InvalidElementException before we finish this collection. The only saving grace is that we are called SO many times that on the last time things should be stable again and we will get a good set of elements for the final update. We need a better mechanism.
DESIGN	TODO Some elements such as Generalization are no longer named. For a transitional period we will return a String so debug can continue but the calling code should probably be fixed. - tfm 20070607 Bob says - these are the comments that were in FacadeEUMLImpl.getName. Same trick is needed here for now.
DESIGN	* * Map of which resources are read-only. * * TODO This needs to be managed per EditingDomain.
DESIGN	* * TODO mvw Would it not be better if this code * would go in startTextEditor() not overruling mouseClicked(). * But we made this fig not editable * to stop it from reacting on key-presses. * Anyhow - this is a hack - abusing a FigText - GEF does * not really support double-clicking on a Fig to trigger some action.
DESIGN	TODO Does CoreHelpergetExtendingClassifiers(Object element) means all direct and indirect extending classifiers or only the direct extending classifiers?
DESIGN	"TODO This code appears to be designed to jump to the diagram containing the contents of the package that was double clicked but it looks like it is always searching for the name ""main"" instead of the package name. TODO But in any case it should be delegating this work to to something that knows about the diagrams and they contents -tfm"
DESIGN	TODO What is the behavior of this in the case of nested models?
DESIGN	TODO Is this returning extended elements or base classes?
DESIGN	TODO InstanceSpecification -> Classifier association is not navigable in this direction
DESIGN	A model element has been removed from this packages namespace If the Fig representing that model element is on the same diagram as this package then make sure it is not enclosed by this package. TODO In my view the Fig representing the model element should be removed from the diagram. Yet to be agreed. Bob.
DESIGN	TODO seems to work only with both loops check why.
DESIGN	TODO This needs to be double checked. - tfm
DESIGN	* * USED BY PGML.tee. * @return the class name and bounds together with compartment * visibility. * TODO Is this not duplicate with the parent?
DESIGN	* * This node cannot be dragged and manipulated in the same way as other * FigNodes in ArgoUML. It is actually an optional child fig (or more precisely * a path item) of a FigEdgeModelElement. * This allows the dashed edge of an association class to connect the * association edge and allows the dashed edge of a comment edge to attach a * comment to some other edge type. * GEF can only attach edges to nodes by making this fig both a node and * containing it as a child of an edge we push the rules to allow edge to edge * connections. * TODO We are inheriting a lot of functionality here that we do not really * require. We should attempt to make FigEdgePort extend FigNode. * * @author Bob Tarling
DESIGN	* * Searches for a stereotype just like the given stereotype in all * given models (and their sub-namespaces). * The given stereotype can not have its namespace set yet * otherwise it will be returned itself! * * TODO This function should not take a stereotype object as parameter * but a name and a baseclass. * TODO Currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass. * TODO Should it only search for stereotypes owned by the Model object? * * @param models a collection of models * @param stereo is the given stereotype * @return Stereotype
DESIGN	* * Finds a stereotype in a given namespace * and all those in any sub-namespace of the given namespace. * Returns null if no such stereotype is found. * * TODO What if stereo.getName() or stereo.getBaseClass() is null? * Then you know immediately that none will be found but is that the * correct answer? * Currently null is returned in these cases. * * TODO This function should not take a stereotype object as parameter * but a name and a baseclass. * TODO Currently only works for stereotypes with only one baseclass. * TODO Currently only works for stereotypes where the baseclass is * equal to the given one - inheritance does not work. * * @return the stereotype found or null. * @param ns is the namespace. * @param stereo is the stereotype.
DESIGN	* * Creates a UML model element of the given type. * This only works for UML elements. If a diagram contains * elements of another type then it is the responsibility * of the diagram manage those items and not call this * method. It also only works for UML model elements that * are represented in diagrams by a node. * * @param elementType the type of model element to build * @return the model element * TODO This needs an extra parameter to specify the model/extent where * the new element should be created.
DESIGN	* * Builds a compositestate as top for some statemachine. * TODO Confusing name this method should better * be named buildTopStateOnStateMachine. * * @param statemachine The given statemachine * @return MCompositeState The newly build top state * @see buildCompositeState(Object)
DESIGN	TODO MVW This needs rethinking/rework! I have the following questions Why does it not search for a stereotype in the namespace using properties and only create a new stereotype if it will actually be used? Ie why is there not a getStereotype(String name String baseClass)? (edited by d00mst)
DESIGN	* * TODO This functionality is in the worn place. We should be able to * call setVisible on the compartment itself and then this class should * react to that event. * Improvements will follow in later releases. * Hence this method should not be considered stable for module developers. * @param compartment the compartment to be changed * @param isVisible true if the attribute compartment is visible
DESIGN	* * TODO This should become private and only called from constructor * * @see org.argouml.uml.diagram.ui.FigCompartmentpopulate()
DESIGN	Remove all items in the group * otherwise the model event listeners remain * TODO Why does a FigGroup not do this?
DESIGN	TODO The above populate works but seems rather heavy here. I can see something like this is needed though as events will not manage this quick enough. Could we make FigEditableCompartment.createModelElement() create the new child Fig instance? It may also be useful for it to return the new model element rather than the current void return - Bob.
DESIGN	* TODO Is this needed/correct? * For when all compartments are hidden?
DESIGN	* * This tag is set on elements that are generated by reference when * importing. * If it is set then the critics could ignore those objects if they want. * * TODO This is really belongs in a higher level utility class * that uses the Facade's tagged value methods.

DESIGN	TODO We should really set up our own profile instead of depending on the default. This depends on the default profile configuration containing the type Integer to test properly. Otherwise it will get created in the main project defeating the purpose
DESIGN	* * Called by propertyChanged when it detects that a stereotype * has been added or removed. On removal the FigNode removes its * listener to that stereotype. When a new stereotype is detected * we add a listener. * TODO Bob says In my opinion we should not be doing this here. * FigStereotype should always be listening to change of its * owners name. * FigStereotypesCompartment should always be listening for add * or remove of Stereotypes to its owner. * Those classes will need to pass some event to the FigNode on * the AWT thread only if a change results in a change of size * that requires a redraw. * NOTE Runs at the Model (MDR) Thread * @param event the UmlChangeEvent that caused the change

DESIGN	* * Agency manages Critics. Since classes are not really first class * objects in java a singleton instance of Agency is made and passed * around as needed.

In the current scheme there is a thread that * proactively continuously critiques the Design at hand even if * the user is idle! This is simple and it works. The disadvantage * is that _all_ active critics related to a given design material are * applied regardless of the reason for the critiquing and a lot of * CPU time is basically wasted. * * TODO I am moving toward a more reactionary scheme in * which specific design manipulations in the editor because critics * relevant to those manipulations to be applied.

DESIGN	TODO THIS IS A HACK. * A much better way of doing this would be not to start * the critic in the first place.
DESIGN	* * Return true iff the given ToDoItem is still valid and should be * kept in the given designers ToDoList. Critics that are not * enabled should always return false so that their ToDoItems will * be removed. Subclasses of Critic that supply multiple offenders * should always override this method. * * By default this method basically asks the critic to again * critique the offending Object and then it checks if the * resulting ToDoItem is the same as the one already posted.

DESIGN	TODO We do not want to do this once we have dropped UML1.3 Map UML 1.4 names to UML 1.3 equivalents
DESIGN	TODO Comment by A- Rueckert I do not think it makes much sense to query interactions from a Collaboration in UML2 since this diagram does no longer exist and an Interaction means something different in UML2.
DESIGN	TODO Comment by A. Rueckert I think the handle holding the collaboration implementation should rather be a CollaborationUse in UML2. But as a workaround for now I will try to get a Collaboration representation (CollaborationUse) and then try to get the owning Classifier from there
DESIGN	TODO This probably cannot be implemented in a way that will make the UML 1.4 UI happy. Needs to be generalized to UML 2 semantics.
DESIGN	TODO What do we want to use as an equivalent here?
DESIGN	TODO Is there an option we can use to save our ArgoUML version?
DESIGN	TODO just a guess probably not right - tfm return handle instanceof LinkEndData
DESIGN	TODO The UML 1.4 concept of a Multiplicity & Multiplicity Range has been replaced by a single element
DESIGN	TODO Not sure the semantics are an exact match here between UML 1.4 Aggregate and UML 2.x Shared.
DESIGN	TODO Changed in UML 2.x to special type of Property?
DESIGN	TODO TagDefinitions are gone from UML 2 they are now Properties of Stereotypes
DESIGN	TODO Moved this out of the implementation-specific piece - tfm everything is primary for now (ie not reverse engineered)
DESIGN	* * This keeps track of the editing domain that is used to track all changes * to the model. * * TODO This probably needs to be a set of EditingDomain so that we can * manage an EditingDomain per project.
DESIGN	TODO This method is mostly (entirely?) redundant - tfm
DESIGN	TODO ActionState CallState and SubactivityState have been replaced in UML 2.0 by explicitly modeled Actions
DESIGN	TODO this does not belong in the implementation specific piece - tfm
DESIGN	TODO The javadoc specifies that null should be returned if 'from' or 'to' are null or if there are no associations between them. We should return an empty collection instead and the javadoc should be changed.
DESIGN	TODO This is not right
DESIGN	TODO Support more than one body/language
DESIGN	TODO Does CoreHelpergetExtendedClassifiers(Object element) means all parents (direct and indirect) or only the direct parents?
DESIGN	"TODO"" What is the purpose of this? Why do we hide buttons here? Presumably if so we should not assume SelectionClass"
DESIGN	TODO We currently delete the old values before setting to something new. This is a workaround to issue 6056. We should consider giving an API to get the lower and upper values so that controls can listen directly to those rather than the element containing those values.
DESIGN	TODO In UML2.x Event has no parameters. The Event metaclass in UML1.x corresponds to the Trigger metaclass in UML2.x (see UML Superstructure page 456).
DESIGN	TODO This should be built by reflection from the metamodel - tfm Update for UML 2.x metamodel if not replaced by reflection
DESIGN	do not implement - deprecated method in interface.
DESIGN	TODO BooleanExpresion is removed from UML2.x is it OK to use ValueSpecification?

DESIGN	TODO Use getModelElementContainer for transition
DESIGN	TODO We should not actually have to do all this work
DESIGN	TODO Hook this creating of a new resource in to someplace more more appropriate (perhaps createModel() ?) Better yet add a new method to Model API to create a new top level project/model/xmi file so we do not depend on side effects
DESIGN	TODO Check for Resource to hold this and create if necessary? This is a discrepancy between MDR which does it here and eUML which does it as part of setRootModel
DESIGN	TODO get/setRootModel are not specific to the Model implementation they could probably be moved elsewhere - tfm - 20070530
DESIGN	I think that the synchronized access to idToObjectMaps is required in order to respect the thread safe nature of the object. FIXME maybe this should be moved into XmiReferenceResolverImpl because it depends on internal implementation details of it.
DESIGN	TODO We can choose between something which matches UML 1.4 in name or something that matches in functionality. we have chosen functionality for now but this will create a name conflict during the migration process. - tfm
DESIGN	TODO Change to throw exception when uses are fixed throw new NotImplementedException() $NON-NLS-1$
DESIGN	* A near clone of this code works fine outside of ArgoUML but throws a * null pointer exception during the transform when run within ArgoUML I * think it is something to do with the class libraries being used but I * cannot figure out what so I have done a simpler less efficient stepwise * translation below in serialTransform
DESIGN	TODO Bob says - Coding by use of side effect here. Maybe this should be done in a clearer way but it fixes It seems that when loading an XMI that is not contained in a zip file then the InputStream given as the argument to this method cannot be reused as it is at the end of the stream. In that case systemId appears to be none-null at this stage. So if systemId is not null we recreate the InputSource.
DESIGN	Create temporary file for output TODO we should be able to chain this directly to XMI reader
DESIGN	* * XmiWriter implementation for MDR. * * This implementation is clumsy because the specified Writer interface wants * characters while the XmiWriter wants an OutputStream dealing in bytes.

DESIGN	"apply <> stereotype to make it a ""profile"" (our convention) (hack create that stereotype instead using the UML 1.4 profile)"
DESIGN	If systemId is a valid URL simply use it. TODO This causes a network connection attempt for profiles

DESIGN	TODO this should call the single namespace form getStereotype(it2.next() stereo)
DESIGN	"TODO still not used because in ArgoUML String is ""hardwired"""
DESIGN	TODO mvw do we really look into super-types of the stereotype * or should we be looking into super-types of the baseclass?
DESIGN	TODO Using just the last piece of the ID leaves the potential for name collisions if two linked files have the same name in different directories
DESIGN	TODO This should use a minimal update strategy instead of removing all and then adding all - tfm - 20070806
DESIGN	TODO What type of validation can we do here on tagType?
DESIGN	TODO this can be simplified to just ((Include) extend).setBase((UseCase) base)
DESIGN	Anything not found is newly created so return a null SystemID indicating that it is in the parent document. TODO This assumption will be invalid if/when we allow editing of linked sub-models
DESIGN	TODO Distinguish between deferred resolution and things which are unresolved at end of load and should be reported to user.
DESIGN	TODO Is this adequate for finding profiles in Java WebStart jars? - tfm
DESIGN	TODO Check whether this is really needed. I think it is left over from an incomplete understanding of the MagicDraw composition error problem - tfm
DESIGN	TODO Not sure whether the above is better in some cases but the code below is better for both Java Web Start and Eclipse.
DESIGN	TODO this returns a Collection not a single Object Is this what the callers expect?
DESIGN	* TODO This code manually processes the ElementImports of a * Package but we need to check whether MDR already does something * similar automatically as part of its namespace processing. * - tfm - 20060408
DESIGN	TODO This has different semantics than everything else
DESIGN	TODO An Iterator filter would be nice here instead of the mucking around with the Collection.
DESIGN	TODO This does not belong here - use getImportedElement.
DESIGN	TODO Rationalize this with getModelElementContainer
DESIGN	TODO Temporary stopgap for EnumerationLiteral
DESIGN	TODO More is required here to support referenceValues
DESIGN	TODO What other non-ModelElement types do we need to handle here?
DESIGN	TODO this assumes ranges are sorted. Is this true? - tfm
DESIGN	This causes problems. It can make multiple return messages refer to the same activator even if not returning to the same classifier role as the activator emenates from.

DESIGN	@author fdietz The following line is not working - just do not know why Main.mainClassLoader.addURLs((URL[]) urlList.toArray(new URL[0])) WORKAROUND Modify the system class loader instead - horrible! But it works!
DESIGN	@author fdietz WORKAROUND we simply append URLs to the existing global class loader and use the same as parent Note that we create a new URL classloader for every class we instanciate. We might want to support hot-swapping of changed classes later.

DEFECT	EATM must fix isSet bits.
DEFECT	is this an error???
DEFECT	line comments at the end of annotations are not a part of the range of annotation TODO is not including line comments at the end of annotations a bug?
DEFECT	EATM in JDK 1.4 there will be an indexOf on StringBuffer.
DESIGN	EATM Call the deprecated method which does the same thing but might have an override in older code.
DESIGN	TODO factor up into GenBaseImpl
DESIGN	TODO deprecate (since getPluginClass() is no longer called)
DESIGN	Ensure that this race condition is thread safe it does not matter who wins the race.
DESIGN	TODO factor up into GenBaseImpl?
DESIGN	TODO This assumes we only get a SET notification which is not a good assumption.
DESIGN	DMS handle this well.
DESIGN	Unused?
DESIGN	FB TBD can we come up with a better algorithm for choosing the default label feature?
DESIGN	DMS What if Eclipse is running but an invalid facade has been specified? We still should format code use encoding
DESIGN	DMS Do a better job with specific exceptions? Just use chained RuntimeExceptions?
DESIGN	If the delegate URI can be handled as a file we will hope that renaming it will be really efficient.
DESIGN	Assume that it is an attribute for now. It will/could become a reference if the type resolves to an EClass.
DESIGN	Do nothing for now and avoid propagating the exception. How should builders handle cancel?
DESIGN	this is a fall-back however this should never be called
DESIGN	TODO fix the space above
DESIGN	TODO REMOVE THIS BOGUS EMPTY LINE
DESIGN	TODO handle class cast exception better.
DESIGN	I do not know if we should be run this deferred because we might have to give the editor a chance to process the viewer update events and hence to update the views first.
DESIGN	This is a big festering hack to make the images the right size from the start.
DESIGN	EATM Demand create metadata needs to depend on processing mode
DESIGN	TBD return (user selected subset?) of referenced packages that contain super classes of classes in this package.
DESIGN	call the workaround
DESIGN	TBD rethink where exactly some of the following methods belong (GenModel or GenPackage)
DESIGN	EATM this would be wrong.
DESIGN	call workaround
DESIGN	The label is not used.
DESIGN	Motif kludge we would get something random instead of null.
DESIGN	TODO So what should be the eType be now?
DESIGN	EATM Kind of hacky.
DESIGN	This runs the operation and shows progress. (It appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread.)
DESIGN	This is a kludge to deal with enumerators which crash the doSwitch.
DESIGN	This is copied from ItemProviderAdapterFactory.
DESIGN	EATM This might be better written as a single loop for the EObject case?
DESIGN	DMS Why not this? new SubProgressMonitor(progressMonitor 1))
DESIGN	Second alternative should be getModelProject()?
DESIGN	TODO This is really quite attrocious since there is code that will assume an iterator that returns strings!
DESIGN	TODO Hack that should be removed.
DESIGN	TODO Specialize this to return a resource locator for messages specific to this validator. Ensure that you remove @generated or mark it @generated NOT
DESIGN	TODO I am concerned that folders will often return 401 or even 403. So should we consider something to exist even though access if unauthorized or forbidden?
DESIGN	Only file-scheme URIs will be re-encoded. If a URI was decoded in the workaround above and Platform.resolve() did not return a file-scheme URI then this will return an decoded URI.
DESIGN	This functionality should eventually go away as it is replaced by model exporters. we will just delegate to the deprecated GenPackage method. The monitor is not used so we will not pass it.
DESIGN	The eAnnotations and eGenericType are possible containment references. we will move them instead of copying
DESIGN	temporary structure to hold node's attributes + namespaces in scope
DESIGN	HACK reading encoding
DESIGN	Because of the old factoring approach in the create method it might be the case that the state of the old value has changed by the time we get here and in that case we do not want to duplicate the removals in this code.
DESIGN	TODO This is faster than many charAt() calls.
DESIGN	REVISIT Remove this code.
DESIGN	REVISIT do we really need to support block names as in Unicode 3.1 or we can just create all the names in IsBLOCKNAME format (XML Schema REC)?
DESIGN	Note Registry based authority is being removed from a new spec for URI which would obsolete RFC 2396. If the spec is added to XML errata processing of reg_name needs to be removed. - mrglavas.
DESIGN	REVISIT Remove this code. Store port value as string instead of integer.
DESIGN	Bubble sort Why? -- In many cases this.ranges has few elements.
DESIGN	Per Schema 1.0 it is not clear if the result returned should be a valid URI. For the future if we plant to support IRIs then it is better not to massage the initialValue. We should thought consider where would be the best way to validate anyURI values -- EL
DESIGN	Note that the way they are sorted the values of index[i++] always increase so the objects are added from right to left in the list. EATM TODO We could make this more efficient by grouping the adds when indices increment by one so that a single grouped notification would result.
DESIGN	TODO deprecate (since no longer used by getEditPluginClass() getEditorPluginClass() getTestSuiteClass())
DESIGN	if there are multiple variables in declaration separate this variable fragment into a separate declaration
DESIGN	DMS should we let this exception out?
DESIGN	DMS factor this into a method? Use a non-static subclass?
DESIGN	DMS this does not really produce nice output.
IMPLEMENTATION	FB TBD filter out volatile and other inappropriate links?
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO processing instructions are not sent to recordValues
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO comments are not sent to recordValues
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO Ignore for now.
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO handle situation when ASTJNode is removed (compilationUnit is null)
IMPLEMENTATION	TBD return super classes of classes in this package that come from a delegate package.
IMPLEMENTATION	if current char is comma insert line break after it we should be able to find the comma because the range for enum constants includes all trailing comments up to the separator if TargetSourceRangeComputer of ASTRewrite changes this logic should change to skip comments see org.eclipse.emf.codegen.merge.java.facade.ast.CommentAwareSourceRangeComputergetEnumConstantSourceRange(ASTNode)
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO translation
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO Binary incompatibility an old override must override putAll.
IMPLEMENTATION	This runs the options and shows progress. (It appears to be a bad thing to fork this onto another thread.)
IMPLEMENTATION	I do not know if this should be run this deferred because we might have to give the editor a chance to process the viewer update events and hence to update the views first.
IMPLEMENTATION	we should be able to find the comma because the range for enum constants includes all preceding comments up to the previous constant if TargetSourceRangeComputer of ASTRewrite changes this logic should change to skip comments see org.eclipse.emf.codegen.merge.java.facade.ast.CommentAwareSourceRangeComputergetEnumConstantSourceRange(ASTNode)
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO we should generate this.
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO What about the instance type name and the fact that we should be matching its type argument structure? If they match so far we must assume they are okay and then check all the arguments.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Iterate over the owner list twice first matching objects from the collection by identity (==) then matching objects by value equality (.equals()). The positions of matched objects in the owner list are recorded and the objects are stored in the same order. The lists are then merged to form a final in-order list of objects and corresponding indices in ownerList. This is very important for undo to interpret the indices correctly. Also this yields exactly one object removed for each object in the collection with preference given to identity over value equality.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The next line leaves objectsBeforeApply with all the objects that were added during the last recording.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for field declarations use variable declaration fragments instead
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	convert only public static final fields
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Give it all back to the garbage collector.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The container class must be null for the open content features of the document root to ensure that they are looked up in the actual eClass() rather than assumed to be a feature with a feature ID relative to the actual class. Otherwise it is good to have this optimization.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the plugin.properties is not within the root of the archive create a new URI for the folder location of the archive so we can look in the folder that contains it.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We do not create an iterator stack until the root mapping itself has been returned by next once. After that the stack should be non-empty and the top iterator should yield true for hasNext.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For demand created created packages we allow the list of classifiers to grow so this should handle those additional instances.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we are on the special resource set iterator and there is not really a next object at this point
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Finds the next occurrence of one of the characters in the set represented by the given bitmask in the given string beginning at index i. The index of the first found character or s.length() if there is none is returned. Before searching i is limited to the range [0 s.length()].
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Then eObject2 must be that previous match.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Create move commands for all the objects in the collection.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We know the first object is not null so if the second one is it cannot be equal.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Some character classes as defined in RFC 2396's BNF for URI. These are 128-bit bitmasks stored as two longs where the Nth bit is set iff the ASCII character with value N is included in the set. These are created with the highBitmask() and lowBitmask() methods defined below and a character is tested against them using matches().

DEFECT	this is only needed (afaict) for processing results from the query cache however this cannot possibly work in the case of discovered types
DEFECT	note that this timestamp is not correct if the connection provider returns an older JDBC connection that was associated with a transaction that was already begun before openSession() was called (do not know any possible solution to this!)

DEFECT	TODO does not work for EntityMode.DOM4J yet!
DEFECT	"TODO Deal with the ""optional"" attribute in the mapping this code assumes that optional defaults to ""true"" because it does not actually seem to work in the fetch=""join"" code Note that actual proper handling of optional-ality here is actually more involved than this patch assumes. Remember that we might have multiple mappings associated with a single entity. Really a couple of things need to happen to properly handle optional here 1) First and foremost when handling multiple s we really should be using the entity root table as the driving table another option here would be to choose some non-optional joined table to use as the driving table. In all likelihood just using the root table is much simplier 2) Need to add the FK columns corresponding to each joined table to the generated select list these would then be used when iterating the result set to determine whether all non-optional data is present My initial thoughts on the best way to deal with this would be to introduce a new SequentialSelect abstraction that actually gets generated in the persisters (ok SingleTable ) and utilized here. It would encapsulated all this required optional-ality checking"
DEFECT	TODO not really completely correct since the uoe could occur while resolving associations leaving the PC in an inconsistent state
DEFECT	TODO this is kind of inconsistent with CollectionType
DEFECT	For a one-to-many a is not really a bag it is *really* a set since it cannot contain the same element twice. It could be considered a bug in the mapping dtd that allows .
DEFECT	TODO entities CAN be compared by PK fix this! -> only if/when we can extract the id values .
DEFECT	TODO old version did not require hashmap lookup keys[collectionOwner].getIdentifier()
DEFECT	TODO this disables laziness even in non-pojo entity modes
DEFECT	TODO at the point where we are resolving collection references we do not know if the uk value has been resolved (depends if it was earlier or later in the mapping document) - now we could try and use e.getStatus() to decide to semiResolve() trouble is that initializeEntity() reuses the same array for resolved and hydrated values
DEFECT	TODO currently we do not know a SessionFactory reference when building the Tuplizer THIS IS A BUG (embedded-xml=false on component) TODO fix this after HHH-1907 is complete
DEFECT	TODO this requires that the collection is defined after the referenced property in the mapping file (ok?)
DEFECT	TODO currently we really do not handle ValueInclusion.PARTIAL ValueInclusion.PARTIAL would indicate parts of a component need to be included in the select currently we then just render the entire component into the select clause in that case.
DEFECT	TODO is this completely correct?
DEFECT	TODO what if batchUpdate is a callablestatement ? calls executeBatch()
DEFECT	This does not actually seem to work but it *might* work on some dbs. Also it does not work if there are multiple columns of results because it is not accounting for the suffix return new String[] { getDiscriminatorColumnName() }
DEFECT	First validate all the enabled filters TODO this implementation has bad performance
DEFECT	TODO passing null here because this method is not really used for DOM4J at the moment but it is still a bug if we do not get rid of this!

DEFECT	TODO this is broke for subqueries in statements other than selects
DEFECT	* The following types are not supported in RDMS/JDBC and therefore commented out. * However in some cases mapping them to CHARACTER columns works * for many applications but does not work for all cases.
DEFECT	TODO should this be an error?
DEFECT	three general cases we check here as to whether to render a physical SQL join 1) is our parent a DotNode as well? If so our property reference is being further de-referenced 2) is this a DML statement 3) we were asked to generate any needed joins (generateJoins==true) *OR* we are currently processing a select or from clause (an additional check is the REGRESSION_STYLE_JOIN_SUPPRESSION check solely intended for the test suite) The REGRESSION_STYLE_JOIN_SUPPRESSION is an additional check intended solely for use within the test suite. This forces the implicit join resolution to behave more like the classic parser. The underlying issue is that classic translator is simply wrong about its decisions on whether or not to render an implicit join into a physical SQL join in a lot of cases. The piece it generally tends to miss is that INNER joins effect the results by further restricting the data set! A particular manifestation of this is the fact that the classic translator will skip the physical join for ToOne implicit joins *if the query is shallow* the result being that Query.list() and Query.iterate() could return different number of results!
DEFECT	TODO figure out how this should be set. / This was the reason for failures regarding INDEX_OP and subclass joins on theta-join dialects not sure what behaviour we were trying to emulate ) joinSequence = joinSequence.getFromPart() Emulate the old addFromOnly behavior.

DEFECT	TODO would be nice to use false but issues with MS SQL
DEFECT	TODO not sure which (either?) is correct could not find docs on how to do this. did find various blogs and forums mentioning that select CURRENT_TIMESTAMP does not work
DEFECT	TODO cannot use generateSuffixes() - it handles the initial suffix differently.
DEFECT	do not need this because we should never ever be selecting no columns in an insert select and because it causes a bug on DB2
DEFECT	starts with an alias (old style) semi-bad thing about this cannot re-alias another alias ..
DEFECT	TODO BUG! this currently fails for named queries for non-POJO entities
DEFECT	FIXME we do not have the associated entity table name here has to be done in a second pass
DEFECT	this call is side-effecty
DEFECT	RDMS does not directly support the trim() function we use rtrim() and ltrim()
DEFECT	note at least my local SQL Server 2005 Express shows this not working
DEFECT	note at least my local MySQL 5.1 install shows this not working
DESIGN	use COUNT as the default. This mimics the old behavior although NONE might be a better option moving forward in the case of callable
DESIGN	perhaps not really necessary
DESIGN	TODO disable batch loading if lockMode > READ?
DESIGN	TODO to handle concurrent writes correctly the client should pass in a Lock
DESIGN	turn hibernate.c3p0.* into c3p0.* so c3p0 gets a chance to see all hibernate.c3p0.*
DESIGN	note there is a wierd implementation in the client side
DESIGN	todo this was added to support initializing an entity's EntityEntry snapshot during reattach this should be refactored to instead expose a method to assemble a EntityEntry based on this state for return.
DESIGN	Do we need to drop constraints before dropping tables in this dialect?
DESIGN	Does this dialect support check constraints?
DESIGN	this is called by SessionFactory irregardless we just disregard here could also add a check to SessionFactory to only conditionally call start
DESIGN	Does this dialect support the UNIQUE column syntax?
DESIGN	this is done here 'cos we might only know the type here (ugly!) TODO improve this a lot
DESIGN	Does this dialect support the FOR UPDATE syntax?
DESIGN	todo what is the implication of this?
DESIGN	todo YUCK!!!
DESIGN	todo again how *should* this work for non-pojo entities?
DESIGN	Does this dialect support FOR UPDATE OF allowing particular rows to be locked?
DESIGN	TODO really bad evil hack to fix!!!
DESIGN	aliasRefNode.resolve( false false aliasRefNode.getText() ) TODO is it kosher to do it here? TODO is it kosher to do it here?
DESIGN	"TODO better to degrade to lazy=""false"" if uninstrumented"
DESIGN	Does this dialect support the Oracle-style FOR UPDATE NOWAIT syntax?
DESIGN	Icky workaround for MySQL bug
DESIGN	we have to set up the table later!! yuck
DESIGN	TODO Somehow add the newly created foreign keys to the internal collection
DESIGN	This inner class implements a case statement .perhaps I am being a bit over-clever here
DESIGN	TODO merge into one method!
DESIGN	TODO this is a bit of copy/paste from IndexedCollection.createPrimaryKey()
DESIGN	TODO what type?
DESIGN	TODO inefficient
DESIGN	TODO this is too conservative if all preceding joins were also inner joins we could use an inner join here
DESIGN	TODO redesign how PropertyAccessors are acquired
DESIGN	TODO not so sure this is needed
DESIGN	TODO joinKeyColumnName & foreignKeyColumnName should be called either here or at a * slightly higer level in the stack (to get all the information we need) * Right now HbmBinder does not support the
DESIGN	TODO improve this hack!
DESIGN	TODO bad implementation cos it depends upon ordering of mapping doc fixing this requires that Collection/PersistentClass gain access to the Mappings reference from Configuration (or the filterDefinitions map directly) sometime during Configuration.buildSessionFactory (after all the types/filter-defs are known and before building persisters).
DESIGN	use of trim() here is ugly?
DESIGN	"TODO ideally we need the construction of PropertyAccessor to take the following 1) EntityMode 2) EntityMode-specific data (i.e. the classname for pojo entities) 3) Property-specific data based on the EntityMode (i.e. property-name or dom4j-node-name) The easiest way with the introduction of the new runtime-metamodel classes would be the the following predicates 1) PropertyAccessorFactory.getPropertyAccessor() takes references to both a org.hibernate.metadata.EntityModeMetadata and org.hibernate.metadata.Property 2) What is now termed a ""PropertyAccessor"" stores any values needed from those two pieces of information 3) Code can then simply call PropertyAccess.getGetter() with no parameters likewise with PropertyAccessor.getSetter()"
DESIGN	ick!
DESIGN	TODO this is very suboptimal for some subclasses (namely components) since it does not take advantage of two-phase-load
DESIGN	TODO should this be Session.instantiate(Persister )?
DESIGN	TODO suck this into initLaziness!
DESIGN	'hibernate.temp.use_jdbc_metadata_defaults' is a temporary magic value. The need for it is intended to be alleviated with future developement thus it is not defined as an Environment constant it is used to control whether we should consult the JDBC metadata to determine certain Settings default values it is useful to *not* do this when the database may not be available (mainly in tools usage).
DESIGN	TODO is this right??
DESIGN	ie. the subquery! yuck!
DESIGN	TODO copy/paste from recreate()
DESIGN	workaround for backward compatibility of sets with no not-null columns assume all columns are used in the row locator SQL
DESIGN	just to help out during the load (ugly i know)
DESIGN	hack/workaround as sqlquery impl depend on having a key.
DESIGN	TODO handle the case of a foreign key to something other than the pk
DESIGN	TODO assumes all collections disassemble to an array!
DESIGN	todo would love to have this work on a notification basis where the successful binding of an entity/subclass would emit a notification which the extendsQueue entries could react to
DESIGN	TODO is it really neceassry to provide Configuration to CollectionPersisters ? Should it not be enough with associated class ? or why does EntityPersister's not get access to configuration ? The only reason I could see that Configuration gets passed to collection persisters is so that they can look up the dom4j node name of the entity element in case no explicit node name was applied at the collection element level. Are you kidding me? Trivial to fix then. Just store and expose the node name on the entity persister (which the collection persister looks up anyway via other means ).
DESIGN	TODO deprecated remove eventually
DESIGN	TODO this is a bit dodgy come up with a better way to check this (plus see above comment)
DESIGN	use a degenerated strategy for backward compatibility
DESIGN	TODO this is temporary in that the end result will probably not take a Property reference per-se.
DESIGN	todo better to handle dynamic filters through implicit DynamicFilterParameterSpecification see the discussion there in DynamicFilterParameterSpecification's javadocs as to why it is currently not done that way.
DESIGN	get the right object from the list would it be easier to just call getEntity() ??
DESIGN	"TODO should ""record"" how many properties we have reffered to - and if we do not get'them'all we throw an exception! Way better than trial and error )"
DESIGN	TODO this dependency is kind of Bad
DESIGN	why does this matter?
DESIGN	important to account for newly saved entities in query todo some kind of check for new status
DESIGN	"TODO can we *always* use the ""null property"" approach for everything?"
DESIGN	"does this need holdlock also? return tableName + "" with (updlock rowlock holdlock)"""
DESIGN	for sets we should end the collection load after resolving the entities since we might call hashCode() on the elements TODO or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	todo remove this and just have subclasses use Isolater/IsolatedWork directly
DESIGN	sql-server at least needed this dropped after use strange!
DESIGN	is it necessary to register %exact since it can only appear in a where clause?
DESIGN	for arrays we should end the collection load before resolving the entities since the actual array instances are not instantiated during loading TODO or we could do this polymorphically and have two different operations implemented differently for arrays
DESIGN	Does this dialect support the ALTER TABLE syntax?
DESIGN	"This next bit is to allow for both unsaved-value=""negative"" and for ""older"" behavior where version number did not get seeded if it was already set in the object TODO shift it into unsaved-value strategy"
DESIGN	TODO reenable if we also fix the above todo
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during copy??
DESIGN	orphans should not be deleted during merge??
DESIGN	TODO suck this logic into the collection!
DESIGN	todo we can actually just determine this from the incoming EntityEntry-s
DESIGN	TODO this bit actually has to be called after all cascades! but since identity insert is called *synchronously* instead of asynchronously as other actions it is not
DESIGN	this class has no proxies (so do a shortcut)
DESIGN	TODO Should this be an InitializeEntityEventListener??? (watch out for performance!)
DESIGN	todo need map? the prob is a proper key right?
DESIGN	TODO better to pass the id in as an argument?
DESIGN	do we even really need this? the update will fail anyway .
DESIGN	TODO would it be better to do a refresh from db?
DESIGN	* * This form used from annotations (?). Essentially the same as the above using a * resultset-mapping reference but without cacheMode readOnly and comment. * * FIXME annotations do not use it so it can be remove from my POV * @deprecated * * * @param query The sql query string * @param resultSetRef The result-set-mapping name * @param querySpaces Any specified query spaces (used for auto-flushing) * @param cacheable Whether the query results are cacheable * @param cacheRegion If cacheable the region into which to store the results * @param timeout A JDBC-level timeout to be applied * @param fetchSize A JDBC-level fetch-size to be applied * @param flushMode The flush mode to use for this query * @param parameterTypes parameter type map * @param callable Does the query string represent a callable object (i.e. proc)
DESIGN	TODO ugly here
DESIGN	this only works because collection entries are kept in a sequenced map by persistence context (maybe we should do like entities and keep a separate sequences set ) TODO calling entrySet on an IdentityMap is SLOW!!
DESIGN	todo I would much rather have this done from endLoadingCollection(CollectionPersisterLoadingCollectionEntry)
DESIGN	"todo hack!!! NOTE here we cleanup the load context when we have no more local LCE entries. This ""works"" for the time being because really only the collection load contexts are implemented. Long term this cleanup should become part of the ""close result set"" processing from the (sandbox/jdbc) jdbc-container code."
DESIGN	todo add the notion of enabled filters to the CacheKey to differentiate filtered collections from non-filtered but CacheKey is currently used for both collections and entities would ideally need to define two seperate ones currently this works in conjuction with the check on DefaultInitializeCollectionEventHandler.initializeCollectionFromCache() (which makes sure to not read from cache with enabled filters). EARLY EXIT!!!!!
DESIGN	PostLoad is needed for EJB3 TODO reuse the PostLoadEvent
DESIGN	todo should we check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	brand new collection TODO or an array!! we cannot lock objects with arrays now??
DESIGN	TODO iteratively get transient entities and retry merge until one of the following conditions 1) transientCopyCache.size() == 0 2) transientCopyCache.size() is not decreasing and copyCache.size() is not increasing TODO find out if retrying can add entities to copyCache (do not think it can ) For now just retry once throw TransientObjectException if there are still any transient entities
DESIGN	null or brand new collection this will also (inefficiently) handle arrays which have no snapshot so we cannot do any better
DESIGN	TODO perhaps we should additionally require that the incoming entity version be equivalent to the defined unsaved-value?
DESIGN	* * Provides query splitting methods which were originally in QueryTranslator. * * TODO This will need to be refactored at some point. * * @author josh
DESIGN	TODO most of below was taken verbatim from DotNode should either delegate this logic or super-type it
DESIGN	todo currently expects that the individual with expressions apply to the same sql table join. This may not be the case for joined-subclass where the property values might be coming from different tables in the joined hierarchy. At some point we should expand this to support that capability. However that has some difficulties 1) the biggest is how to handle ORs when the individual comparisons are linked to different sql joins. 2) here we would need to track each comparison individually along with the join alias to which it applies and then pass that information back to the FromElement so it can pass it along to the JoinSequence
DESIGN	No explicit select expression render the id and properties projection lists for every persister in the from clause into a single 'token node'. TODO the only reason we need this stuff now is collection filters we should get rid of derived select clause completely!
DESIGN	TODO better way?!?
DESIGN	"/ HACK ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Attempt to work around ""ghost"" ImpliedFromElements that occasionally show up between the actual things being joined. This consistently occurs from index nodes (at least against many-to-many). Not sure if there are other conditions Essentially look-ahead to the next FromElement that actually writes something to the SQL"
DESIGN	Not possible to simply re-use the versionPropertyNode here as it causes OOM errors due to circularity (
DESIGN	this function has a template -> restore output apply the template and write the result out TODO Downcast to avoid using an interface? Yuck.
DESIGN	at some point the generate phase needs to be moved out of here because a single object-level DML might spawn multiple SQL DML command executions. Possible to just move the sql generation for dml stuff but for consistency-sake probably best to just move responsiblity for the generation phase completely into the delegates (QueryLoader/StatementExecutor) themselves. Also not sure why QueryLoader currently even has a dependency on this at all does it need it? Ideally like to see the walker itself given to the delegates directly
DESIGN	TODOthis is only needed during compilation .. can we eliminate the instvar?
DESIGN	TODO absolutely no usages of this constructor form can it go away?
DESIGN	TODO is this a bit ugly?
DESIGN	"even here if only properties mapped to the ""base table"" are referenced in the set and where clauses this could be handled by the BasicDelegate. TODO decide if it is better performance-wise to perform that check or to simply use the MultiTableUpdateDelegate"
DESIGN	TODO remove these last two as batcher is no longer managing connections
DESIGN	VERY IMPORTANT!!!! - This class needs to be free of any static references to any CGLIB or Javassist classes. Otherwise users will always need both on their classpaths no matter which (if either) they use. Another option here would be to remove the Hibernate.isPropertyInitialized() method and have the users go through the SessionFactory to get this information.
DESIGN	TODO we really need to be able to deal with component paths here also this is difficult because the hql-sql grammar expects all those node types to be FromReferenceNodes. One potential fix here would be to convert the IntoClause to just use a FromClause/FromElement combo (as a child of the InsertStatement) and move all this logic into the InsertStatement. that is probably the easiest approach (read least amount of changes to the grammar and code) but just does not feel right as then an insert would contain 2 from-clauses
DESIGN	TODO an optimization here would be to consider cascade deletes and not gen those delete statements the difficulty is the ordering of the tables here vs the cascade attributes on the persisters -> the table info gotten here should really be self-contained (i.e. a class representation defining all the needed attributes) then we could then get an array of those
DESIGN	TODO switch statements are always evil! We already had bugs because of forgotten token types. Use polymorphism for this!
DESIGN	really there are two situations where it should be ok to allow the insertion into properties defined on a superclass 1) union-subclass with an abstract root entity 2) discrim-subclass 1 is handled already because of the fact that UnionSubclassPersister alreay always returns 0 for this call we may want to disallow it for discrim-subclass just for consistency-sake (currently does not work anyway)
DESIGN	implicit joins are always(?) ok to reuse
DESIGN	TODO used to be exprNoParens! was this needed?
DESIGN	TODO we may also want to check that the types here map to exactly one column/JDBC-type cannot think of a situation where arithmetic expression between multi-column mappings makes any sense.
DESIGN	we do not know either type BLIND GUESS!
DESIGN	TODO get SQL rendering out of here create an AST for the join expressions. Use the SQL generator grammar to generate the SQL text for the index expression.
DESIGN	We would probably refactor to have LogicParser (builds a tree of simple expressions connected by and or not) ExpressionParser (translates from OO terms like foo foo.Bar foo.Bar.Baz to SQL terms like FOOS.ID FOOS.BAR_ID etc) and PathExpressionParser (which does much the same thing it does now)
DESIGN	short-circuit for performance
DESIGN	not absolutely necessary but does help with aggressive release
DESIGN	try block is a hack around fact that currently tuplizers are not given the opportunity to resolve a subclass entity name. this allows the (we assume custom) interceptor the ability to influence this decision if we were not able to based on the given entityName
DESIGN	TODO this is one of the ugliest and most fragile pieces of code in Hibernate .
DESIGN	"TODO implement functionality this might be painful to do here as the ""join post processing"" for the subquery has already been performed (meaning that for theta-join dialects the join conditions have already been moved over to the where clause). A ""simple"" solution here might to perform ""join post processing"" once for the entire query (including any subqueries) at one fell swoop"
DESIGN	ignore it the incoming property could not be found so we cannot be sure what to do here. At the very least the safest is to simply not apply any dereference toggling
DESIGN	todo potentially look at optimizing these two arrays
DESIGN	note that i parameter is now unused (delete it?)
DESIGN	TODO Figure out a better way to get the FROM elements in a proper tree structure. If this is not the destination of a many-to-many add it as a child of the origin.
DESIGN	TODO this constructor form is *only* used from constructor directly below us can it go away?
DESIGN	We should reengineer this class so that rather than the current ad - hoc linear approach to processing a stream of tokens we instead build up a tree of expressions.
DESIGN	"todo should this get moved to PersistentContext? logically is PersistentContext the ""thing"" to which an interceptor gets attached?"
DESIGN	TODO something much better - look at the type of the other expression! TODO Have comparisonExpression and/or arithmeticExpression rules complete the resolution of boolean nodes.
DESIGN	TODO this class does too many things! we need a different kind of path expression parser for each of the diffferent ways in which path expressions can occur
DESIGN	TODO optimize this better!
DESIGN	TODO should we allow suffixes on these ?
DESIGN	TODO not sure the best way to handle this. The non-performant way
DESIGN	TODO is there a better way?
DESIGN	The class is now way to complex!
DESIGN	TODO would be really nice to cache the spec on the query-def so as to not have to re-calc the hash currently not doable though because of the resultset-ref stuff
DESIGN	name from a super query (a bit inelegant that it shows up here)
DESIGN	real hacky used to count the nesting of parentheses
DESIGN	"ugly hack for cases like ""elements(foo.bar.collection)"" (multi-part path expression ending in elements or indices)"
DESIGN	TODO COPY/PASTE FROM SessionImpl pull up!
DESIGN	"todo need to find a clean way to handle the ""event source"" role a seperate classs responsible for generating/dispatching events just duplicates most of the Session methods passing around seperate reto interceptor factory actionQueue and persistentContext is not manageable"
DESIGN	Must be done here because of side-effect! yuck
DESIGN	We should actually rework this class to not implement Parser and just process path expressions in the most convenient way.
DESIGN	TODO should remove this exposure and have all references to the session's batcher use the ConnectionManager.
DESIGN	we may be screwed here since the collection action is about to execute and we do not know the final owner key value
DESIGN	"Needed the ""clazz_"" check to work around union-subclasses TODO is there a way to tell whether a persister is truly discrim-column based inheritence?"
DESIGN	work around a bug in all known connection pools .
DESIGN	TODO reuse the PreLoadEvent
DESIGN	Need a better way to define the suffixes here
DESIGN	workaround for WebLogic
DESIGN	TODO temporary
DESIGN	TODO YUCK!!! fix after HHH-1907 is complete
DESIGN	would be great to move all this below here into another method that could also be used from the new scrolling stuff. Would need to change the way the max-row stuff is handled (i.e. behind an interface) so that I could do the control breaking at the means to know when to stop
DESIGN	TODO the i==entitySpan-1 bit depends upon subclass implementation (very bad)
DESIGN	some messy complex stuff here since createCriteria() can take an aliased path or a path rooted at the creating criteria instance
DESIGN	TODO add a CriteriaImplementor interface this class depends directly upon CriteriaImpl in the impl package
DESIGN	polymorphism not really handled completely correctly perhaps well actually its ok assuming that the entity name used in the lookup is the same as the the one used here which it will be
DESIGN	This is not very nice (and quite slow)
DESIGN	TODO get SQL rendering out of here
DESIGN	meant to handle dynamic instantiation queries (Copy from QueryLoader)
DESIGN	Make sure this is a defined parameter and check the incoming value type TODO what should be the actual exception type here?
DESIGN	worrying about proxies is perhaps a little bit of overkill here
DESIGN	todo throw exception? maybe warn if not the same?
DESIGN	TODO make EntityPersister *not* depend on SessionFactoryImplementor interface if possible
DESIGN	TODO what amount of significant digits need to be supported here? - from the DecimalFormat docs [significant digits] = [minimum integer digits] + [maximum fraction digits]
DESIGN	for backward compatibility allow a set with no not-null element columns using all columns in the row locater SQL TODO create an implicit not null constraint on all cols?
DESIGN	TODO copy/paste from ManyToOneType
DESIGN	TODO code duplication with SingleTableEntityPersister
DESIGN	todo throw exception?
DESIGN	should this interface extend PropertyMapping?
DESIGN	TODO here is why we need to make bytecode provider global ( TODO again fix this after HHH-1907 is complete
DESIGN	TODO currently keeps Getters and Setters (instead of PropertyAccessors) because of the way getGetter() and getSetter() are implemented currently yuck!
DESIGN	TODO Yuck! This is not quite good enough it is a quick hack around the problem of having a to-one association that refers to an embedded component
DESIGN	TODO implement caching?! proxies?!
DESIGN	is this really necessary?
DESIGN	TODO this is a little inefficient do not need to do a whole deep replaceElements() call
DESIGN	TODO this is a bit arbitrary expose a switch to the user?
DESIGN	"* * @return collection removal * FIXME even if isInverse=""true""?"
DESIGN	TODO Fix this so it will work for non-POJO entity mode
DESIGN	TODO move these to a new JoinableType abstract class extended by EntityType and PersistentCollectionType
DESIGN	TODO would be nice to handle proxy classes elegantly!
DESIGN	SPACES TODO I am not sure but perhaps we should exclude abstract denormalized tables?
DESIGN	TODO is there a more elegant way than downcasting?
DESIGN	TODO remove use of instanceof!
DESIGN	TODO make this a bit nicer
DESIGN	todo we can remove this once the deprecated ctor can be made private
DESIGN	TODO perhaps this should be some other RuntimeException
DESIGN	Yuck
DESIGN	TODO need some caching scheme? really comes down to decision regarding amount of state (if any) kept on PropertyAccessors
DESIGN	todo this eventually needs to be removed
DESIGN	TODO design new lifecycle for ProxyFactory
DESIGN	todo we should really just collect these from the various SelectExpressions rather than regenerating here
DESIGN	TODO Should this really return null? If not figure out something better to do here.
DESIGN	todo should seriously consider not allowing a txn to begin from a child session can always route the request to the root session
DESIGN	"should indicate that we are processing an INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE query with a subquery implied via a collection property function. Here we need to use the table name itself as the qualification alias. TODO verify this works for all databases TODO is this also the case in non-""indexed"" scenarios?"
DESIGN	TODO this really needs to be delayed unitl after we definitively know all node types where this is currently a problem is parameters for which where we cannot unequivocally resolve an expected type
DESIGN	"TODO make this the factory for ""entity mode related"" sessions also means making this the target of transaction-synch and the thing that knows how to cascade things between related sessions At that point perhaps this thing is a ""SessionContext"" and ConnectionManager is a ""JDBCContext""? A ""SessionContext"" should live in the impl package"
DESIGN	create an index on the key columns??
DESIGN	is this ok?
DESIGN	init the table here instead of earlier so that we can get a quoted table name TODO would it be better to simply pass the qualified table name instead of splitting it up into schema/catalog/table names
DESIGN	perhaps this should be an exception since it is only ever used in the above method?
DESIGN	NOTE this assumes something about how propertySelectFragment is implemented by the subclass! was toUnqotedAliasStrings( getdiscriminatorColumnName() ) before - now tried to remove that unqoting and missing aliases..
DESIGN	Put a placeholder in entries so we do not recurse back and try to save() the same object again. QUESTION should this be done before onSave() is called? likewise should it be done before onUpdate()?
DESIGN	before cascade! TODO should this be Session.instantiate(Persister )?
DESIGN	TODO we should throw an exception if we really *know* for sure that this is a detached instance rather than just assuming throw new StaleObjectStateException(entityName id)
DESIGN	TODO The order in which entities are saved may matter (e.g. a particular transient entity may need to be saved before other transient entities can be saved Keep retrying the batch of transient entities until either 1) there are no transient entities left in transientCopyCache or 2) no transient entities were saved in the last batch For now just run through the transient entities and retry the merge
DESIGN	TODO if object was an uninitialized proxy this is inefficient resulting in two SQL selects
DESIGN	TODO put this stuff back in to read snapshot from the second-level cache (needs some extra work)
DESIGN	TODO not quite sure about the full implications of this!
DESIGN	this is kind of the best we can do
DESIGN	TODO this need not exclude subclasses
DESIGN	TODO we use two visitors here inefficient!
DESIGN	trim done to workaround stupid oracle bug that cannot handle whitespaces before a { in a sp
DESIGN	TODO does this really need to be here? does the collection already have it is own up-to-date snapshot?
DESIGN	"otherwise a trim-specification and/or a trim-character have been specified we need to decide which options are present and ""do the right thing"" should leading trim-characters be trimmed? should trailing trim-characters be trimmed? the trim-character the trim-source"
DESIGN	it is possible that the tree-walking in OuterJoinLoader can get to an association defined by a subclass in which case the property-ref might refer to a property defined on a subclass of the current class in this case the table name is not known - this temporary solution assumes that the property-ref refers to a property of the subclass table that the association belongs to (a reasonable guess) TODO fix this add OuterJoinLoadable.getSubclassPropertyTableName(String propertyName)
DESIGN	TODO an alternative is to check if the owner has changed if it has not then return collection.getOwner()
DESIGN	I suppose?
DESIGN	"TBD should this be varbinary($1)? registerColumnType(Types.VARBINARY ""binary($1)"")"
DESIGN	shortcut
DESIGN	TODO we should provide some way to get keys of collection of statistics to make it easier to retrieve from a GUI perspective
DESIGN	TODO probably better to calculate these and pass them in as it will be more performant
DESIGN	todo should we additionally check the current isolation mode explicitly?
DESIGN	TODO simply remove this override if we fix the above todos
DESIGN	todo is there really any reason to kkeep trying if this fails once?
DESIGN	TODO not sure this is correct could not find docs on how to do this.
DESIGN	HSQL has no Blob/Clob support . but just put these here for now!
DESIGN	merges do not cascade to uninitialized collections TODO perhaps this does need to cascade after all .
DESIGN	yick! need this for proper serialization/deserialization handling
DESIGN	TODO should orphans really be deleted during lock???
DESIGN	todo move to StringHelper?
DESIGN	Sets can be just a view of a part of another collection. do we need to copy it to be sure it will not be changing underneath us? ie. this.set.addAll(set)
DESIGN	TODO It would be really really nice to use this to also model components!
DESIGN	TODO move to .sql package!!
DESIGN	TODO look at the owning property and check that it is not lazy (by instrumentation)
DESIGN	TODO add this info to the translator and aggregate it here
DESIGN	TODO possibly relax that
DESIGN	would be better to use the element-type to determine whether the old and the new are equal here the problem being we do not necessarily have access to the element type in all cases
DESIGN	TODO code duplication with JoinedSubclassEntityPersister
DESIGN	TODO refactor to .sql package
DESIGN	TODO *two* hashmap lookups here is one too many
DESIGN	note that this method could easily be moved up to BasicEntityPersister if we ever needed to reuse it from other subclasses
DESIGN	from the collection of associations locate OJA for the ManyToOne corresponding to this persister to fully define the many-to-many we need that OJA so that we can use its alias here TODO is there a better way here?
DESIGN	TODO this class depends directly upon CriteriaImpl in the impl package add a CriteriaImplementor interface
DESIGN	Do we need to qualify index names with the schema name?
DESIGN	TODO We probably should have a StatisticsNotPublishedException to make it clean
DESIGN	TODO get SQL rendering out of this package!
DESIGN	yukky! do not you have subclasses for that! TODO race conditions can happen here
DESIGN	NOTE VERY HACKISH WORKAROUND!! TODO Fix this so it will work for non-POJO entity mode

DESIGN	"for DOM4J ""collections"" only TODO it would be better if this was done at the higher level by Printer"

DESIGN	TODOrefactor + make this method private
DESIGN	TODO keep seperate notions of QT[] here for shallow/non-shallow queries
DESIGN	todo temporary needed because currently persister is the one that creates and renders the join fragments for inheritence hierarchies

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We call getKeyFromResultSet() here so that we can know the key value upon which to perform the breaking logic.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if we get here it is possible that we have a proxy 'in the way' of the merge map resolution NOTE decided to put this here rather than in the above loop as I was nervous about the performance of the loop-in-loop especially considering this is far more likely the 'edge case'

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection.clearDirty()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not need to worry about existing version being uninitialized because this block is not called by a re-entrant load (re-entrant loads _always_ have lock mode NONE)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note this affects the return value!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isTransactionCallbackRegistered denotes whether any Hibernate Transaction has registered as a callback against this JDBCContext only one such callback is allowed. Directly serializing this value causes problems with JDBCTransaction or really any Transaction impl where the callback is local to the Transaction instance itself since that Transaction is not serialized along with the JDBCContext. Thus we handle that fact here explicitly
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE evict() operates locally only (i.e. does not propogate to any other nodes in the potential cluster). This is exactly what is needed when we destroy() here destroy() is used as part of the process of shutting down a SessionFactory thus these removals should not be propogated

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Regions can get instantiated in the course of normal work (e.g. a named query region will be created the first time the query is executed) so suspend any ongoing tx
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE this is not updated when properties are fetched lazily!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	An ident node can represent an index expression if the ident represents a naked property ref *Note this makes the assumption (which is currently the case in the hql-sql grammar) that the ident is first resolved itself (addrExpr -> resolve()). The other option if that changes is to call resolve from here but it is currently un-needed overhead.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Add the token to the AST.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the table fromElement and the property name to get the array of column names.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should not happen since the DTD prevents it
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Need to parse off the column qualifiers this is assuming (which is true as of now) that this is only used from update and delete HQL statement parsing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"the current join represents the join between a many-to-many association table and its ""target"" table. Here we need to apply any additional filters defined specifically on the many-to-many"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the from element represents a JOIN_FRAGMENT and it is a theta-style join convert its type from JOIN_FRAGMENT to FROM_FRAGMENT
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check basic level one nullablilty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Add a zero (or quite low) timeout option so we do not block. Ignore any TimeoutException. Basically we forego caching the query result in order to avoid blocking. Reads are done with suspended tx so they should not hold the lock for long. Not caching the query result is OK since any subsequent read will just see the old result with its out-of-date timestamp that result will be discarded and the db query performed again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	values is not null and is checkable we will look deeper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Possibly handle something parameters for the query ?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for non null args check for components and elements containing components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we want to handle it bidirectional and detached we also need to load this collection with an eager outer-join fetch this time with Criteria and not HQL
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	public PropertyProjection project() { return Projections.property(getPropertyName()) }
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	persistent collections may have components
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We have the JBCWriteMutex so no other *local* thread will be trying to write this key. it is possible here some remote thread has come in and changed the values again but since we are reading the values to write to JBC right now we know we are writing the latest values i.e. we do not assume that what we cached in entry.update() above is what we should write to JBC *now*. Our write could be redundant i.e. we are writing what some remote thread just came in an wrote. There is a chance that yet another remote thread will update us and we will then overwrite that later data in JBC. But all remote nodes will ignore that change in their localCache the only place it will live will be in JBC where it can only effect the initial state transfer values on newly joined nodes (i.e. populateLocalCache()).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"registerColumnType( Types.VARCHAR 16777215 ""mediumtext"" )"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	IDENT might be the name of a class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Here we do not want to suspend the tx. If we do 1) We might be caching query results that reflect uncommitted changes. No tx == no WL on cache node so other threads can prematurely see those query results 2) No tx == immediate replication. More overhead plus we spread issue 1 above around the cluster
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	TODO!!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"for regression testing against output from the old parser found it easiest to simply reorder the FromElements here into ascending order in terms of injecting them into the resulting sql ast in orders relative to those expected by the old parser this is definitely another of those ""only needed for regression purposes"".

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an unfetched association can only point to an entity that already exists in the db
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	here we work under the following assumptions ------------ valid cases -------------------------------------- 1) datetime + {something other than datetime} always results in a datetime ( db will catch invalid conversions ) 2) datetime - datetime always results in a DOUBLE 3) datetime - {something other than datetime} always results in a datetime ( db will catch invalid conversions ) ------------ invalid cases ------------------------------------ 4) datetime + datetime 5) {something other than datetime} - datetime 6) datetime * {any type} 7) datetime / {any type} 8) {any type} / datetime doing so allows us to properly handle parameters as either the left or right side here in the majority of cases

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database now holds a lock + the object is flushed from the cache so release the soft lock
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now update the object .. has to be outside the main if block above (because of collections)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Named Queries
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this is a situation where the entity id is assigned by a post-insert generator and was saved outside the transaction forcing it to be delayed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	grab its state saved at deletion
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	grab its current state
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection deletions are a special case since update() can add deletions of collections not loaded by the session.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the natural-id is marked as non-mutable it is not retrieved during a normal database-snapshot operation

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it was dirtied by a collection only
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check nullability but do not perform command execute we will use scheduled updates for that.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The CollectionEntry.isReached() stuff is just to detect any silly users who set up circular or shared references between/to collections.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	some filters affecting the collection are enabled on the session so do not do the put into the cache.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Generate an explicit join for the root dot node. The implied joins will be collected and passed up to the root dot node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	A session is considered to contain an entity only if the entity has an entry in the session's persistence context and the entry reports that the entity has not been removed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	and the token could be an identifer and the error is a mismatched token error
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If a where clause was specified in the update/delete query use it to limit the returned ids here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Default implementation If this node has a data type and that data type is not an association then this is scalar.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Resolve the LHS fully generate implicit joins. Pass in the property name so that the resolver can discover foreign key (id) properties.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the propertyType is null and there is not a parent just stop now there was a problem resolving the node anyway.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We do not look for an existing join on the same path because it makes sense to join twice on the same collection role

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Parse the query string into an HQL AST.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	So this needs to be safe from concurrent modification problems. It is safe because of how IdentityMap implements entrySet()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only needed during compilation phase
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Update the status of the object and if necessary schedule an update
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Schedule updates to collections
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to lock the collection caches before executing entity inserts/updates in order to account for bidi associations
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the database has changed now so the subselect results need to be invalidated
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the collection is dereferenced remove from the session cache iter.remove() does not work since the entrySet is not backed by the set

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Ensures that containing deletions happen before sub-deletions
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade-delete to collections BEFORE the collection owner is deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade-delete to many-to-one AFTER the parent was deleted
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if it is an initialized proxy let cascade handle it later on
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assign the requested id to the proxy *before* reassociating the proxy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an uninitialized proxy noop do not even need to return an id since it is never a save()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	initialize properties of the event
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return the id in the event object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	TRANSIENT or DELETED
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume this is a newly instantiated transient object which should be saved rather than updated

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	note performExecutions() clears all collectionXxxxtion collections (the collection actions) in the session
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ie. the entity came in from update()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to check even if it was not initialized because of delayed adds!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if template is null we just write the function out as it appears in the hql statement

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Initialize SQL nodes here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Check the persistence context for an entry relating to this entity to be merged

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that entity id = requestedId
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Not a collection? Return the entity property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	collection of mappings used to circumvent the component-collection check below
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Otherwise the destination node was implied by the FROM clause and the FROM clause processor will automatically add it in the right place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the first identifier in the path referrs to the class alias (not the class name) then this is a correlated subselect. If it is a correlated sub-select use the existing table alias. Otherwise generate a new one.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	origin.addDestination(destination) Add the query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Reset the node type because the rest of the system is expecting FROM_FRAGMENT all we wanted was for the factory to create the right sub-class. This might get reset again later on anyway to make the SQL generation simpler.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	explicit = true This is an explict Select. ArrayList sqlResultTypeList = new ArrayList()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	sqlResultTypeList.add( type ) Generate the select expression.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the expression list has exactly one expression and the type of the expression is a collection then this might be a collection function such as index(c) or size(c).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The uber-rule here is that we need to include subclass joins if the FromElement is in any way dereferenced by a property from the subclass table otherwise we end up with column references qualified by a non-existent table reference in the resulting SQL
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	before cascade!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	cascade first so that all unsaved objects get their copy created before we actually copy
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	copyValues works by reflection so explicitly mark the entity instance dirty
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The following variables are stacks that keep information about each subexpression in the list of nested subexpressions we are currently processing.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no need to even collect this information if the persister is considered multi-table
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	as soon as we encounter our first letter return the substring from that position
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Retrieve the value of the designated column in the current row of this ResultSet object as a java.io.Reader object
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for arrays replaceElements() may return a different reference since the array length might not match
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not be able to reach last without maxPosition being set unless there are no results
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not use proxiesByKey since not all proxies that point to this session's instances are in that collection!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this should be a call to resolve() not resolveIdentifier() 'cos it might be a property-ref and we did not cache the referenced value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"If we have not-found=""ignore"" association mapped to a formula we always need to dirty check it so we can update the second-level cache"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We now have the value of the property-ref we reference. However we need to dig a little deeper as that property might also be an entity type in which case we need to resolve its identitifier
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	true if this is a query and we are loading multiple instances of the same collection role otherwise this is a CollectionInitializer and we are loading up a single collection or batch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This method should be implemented assuming it is valid to do start/stop/start -- leave state appropriate for another start
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We do not want to waste effort setting an option if JBC is already in LOCAL mode. If JBC is REPL_(A)SYNC then check if they passed an config option to disable query replication
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	See if we had a 2nd invalidation from the same initial preinvalidation timestamp. If so only increment if the new current value is an increase
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the workspace node has null as well OK if not we have been modified in a non-comparable manner which we have to treat as us being newer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	maintain correct duplication if loaded in a cartesian product
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	DataSource unpooled = DataSources.unpooledDataSource( jdbcUrl props.getProperty(Environment.USER) props.getProperty(Environment.PASS) )
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not need to lock the cache here since if someone else inserted the same pk first the insert would fail
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to grab the version value from the entity otherwise we have issues with generated-version entities that may have multiple actions queued during the same flush
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	short-circuit(s) no new elements the old list contains only Orphans no old elements so no Orphans neither
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	test out the optimizer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	get the updated snapshot of the entity state by cloning current state it is safe to copy in place since by this time no-one else (should have) has a reference to the array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	!persister.isCacheInvalidationRequired()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Set the existing pool flag to true
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We have created the pool ourselves so shut it down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the load() which takes an entity does not pass an entityName
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Note expected in the syntax type=listenerClass ({sep}type=listenerClass)* where {sep} is any whitespace or comma
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tree cache in optimistic mode seems to have as very difficult time with remove calls on non-existent nodes (NPEs)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We ignore minimalPutOverride. JBossCache putForExternalRead is already about as minimal as we can get it will promptly return if it discovers that the node we want to write to already exists
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do nothing for persistent instances
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	OptimisticCache impl ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	option.setDataVersion( NonLockingDataVersion.INSTANCE )
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	assume true since we do not really know and it does not matter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Show the modified AST.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Initialize dirty flags for arrays + collections with composite elements and reset reached doupdate etc.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Tell the dot node about the join type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This 'dot' expression now refers to the resulting from element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Among other things updateReachables() will recursively load all collections that are moving roles. This might because entities to be loaded.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Post-flushing section ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise recreate the mapping between the collection and its key
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Create a parameter specification for the collection filter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"Attach any mapping-defined ""ORDER BY"" fragments"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we found some extends attributes referencing entities which were not already processed. here we need to locate all entity-names and class-names contained in this document itself making sure that these get removed from the extendz list such that only extends names which require us to delay processing (i.e. external to this document and not yet processed) are contained in the returned result
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure that the persister is versioned
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for native-sql queries the param metadata is determined outside any relation to a query plan because query plan creation and/or retreival for a native-sql query depends on all of the return types having been set which might not be the case up-front when param metadata would be most useful
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this function has a template -> redirect output and catch the arguments
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use the id assigned to the instance
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if no array holder we found an unwrappered array (this cannot occur because we now always call wrap() before getting to here) return (ah==null) ? true searchForDirtyCollections(ah type)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the data type is not an association type it could not have been in the FROM clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We need to generate ids as part of this bulk insert. Note that this is only supported for sequence-style generators and post-insert-style generators basically only in-db generators
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	first look for a reference to a projection alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If there are no collection fetches then no further checks are needed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	--Commented out by Inspection (12/11/04 1056 AM) int getWarningCount()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if a ThreadLocalSessionContext-bound session happens to get serialized to be completely correct we need to make sure that unbinding of that session occurs.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make @%$^^ sure no alias is applied to the table name
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Delegate to the QueryLoader
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not actually propogate ANTLRExceptions as a because so log it here for diagnostic purposes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the explicitly declared select expression determine the return types indicated by each select token
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	select clauses for insert statements should alwasy be treated as shallow
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	After that process the JOINs. Invoke a delegate to do the work as this is farily complex.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Cache impl ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"simple cache of param metadata based on query string. Ideally the original ""user-supplied query"" string should be used to retreive this metadata (i.e. not the para-list-expanded query string) to avoid unnecessary cache entries. Used solely for caching param metadata for native-sql queries see getSQLParameterMetadata() for a discussion as to why"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Alias references and identifiers use the same node class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	these are just two unrelated table references
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again both should be FromElements
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check a set of parent/child nodes in the from-clause tree to determine if a comma is required between them
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	PHASE 2 Analyze the HQL AST and produce an SQL AST.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	PHASE 3 Generate the SQL.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Otherwise we have a non-scalar select with defined collection fetch(es). Make sure that there is only a single root entity in the return (no tuples)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	paramTranslations = new ParameterTranslationsImpl( collectedParameterSpecifications )
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are already processing a dot-structure
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Should mean that no such property was found
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Was there an explicit select expression?
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Resolve everything up to this dot but do not resolve the placeholders yet.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	(NOT (NOT_BETWEEN a b) ) => (BETWEEN a b)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Just add a 'not' parent.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	First save off the pertinent ids as the return value
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if the connection is in auto-commit mode (no connection means aggressive connection release outside a JTA transaction context so MUST be autocommit mode)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	First save off the pertinent ids saving the number of pertinent ids for return
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Start performing the deletes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not forget to resolve the argument! Resolve the collection function now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise everything ok.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Re-arrange the tree so that the collection function is the root and the lhs is the path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	protected RegionRootListener listener
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	inject the WHERE after the parent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Never include subclasses for implied from elements.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Establish the region root node with a non-locking data version
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For pessimistic locking we just want to toss out our ref to any old invalid root node and get the latest (may be null)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The rest only matters for optimistic locking where we need to establish the proper data version on the region root
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this dot has already been resolved stop now.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The property is another class..
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Otherwise this is a primitive type.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	foo.bars.size (also handles deprecated stuff like foo.bars.maxelement for backwardness)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For Timestamps we default to a separate config
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"optimistic-lock=""all"" include all updatable properties optimistic-lock=""dirty"" include all properties we are updating this time"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"this property belongs to the table and it is not specifically excluded from optimistic locking by optimistic-lock=""false"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	information about properties of this class including inherited properties (only really needed for updatable/insertable properties)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Here we render the select column list based on the properties defined as being generated. For partial component generation we currently just re-select the whole component rather than trying to handle the individual generated portions.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NOTE addDuplicateAlias() already performs nullness checks on the alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if the from-clauses are the same we can be a little more aggressive in terms of what we reuse
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	again null != null here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise (subquery case) do not reuse the fromElement if we are processing the from-clause of the subquery
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the lhs-hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the referenced node text is the special 'id'
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	only the identifier property field name can be a reference to the associated entity's PK
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	special shortcut for id properties skip the join! this must only occur at the _end_ of a path expression
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Append the new property name onto the unresolved path.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Tell the destination fromElement to 'includeSubclasses'.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the lhs is a collection use CollectionPropertyMapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not resolve the node again.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	lists arrays sets maps bags
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"we have something like ""? [op] rhs"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Configure the cache to use our TM
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure JBC does not look one up
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"we finish all the ""removes"" first to take care of possible unique constraints and so that we can take better advantage of batching"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use a combination of foreign key columns and pk columns since the ordering of removal and addition is not guaranteed when a child moves from one parent to another
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure we do not re-release the same cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We use a different delegate than the non-optimistic superclass default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"we have something like ""lhs [op] ?"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not create a unique key 'cos some databases do not like a UK on nullable columns getCollectionTable().createUniqueKey( getIdentifier().getConstraintColumns() )
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	isSet = collection.isSet() isSorted = collection.isSorted()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we know only the rhs-hand type so use that
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If JBC is using INVALIDATION we do not want to propagate changes. We use the Timestamps cache to manage invalidation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not hold the JBC node lock throughout the tx as that prevents updates Add a zero (or low) timeout option so we do not block waiting for tx's that did a put to commit
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Double check the distributed cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Get an exclusive right to update JBC for this key from this node.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	one or the other needs to be a datetime for us to get into this method in the first place
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Add the condition to the join sequence that qualifies the indexed element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Sometimes use the element table alias sometimes use the umm collection table alias (many to many)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Now set the text for this node. It should be the element columns.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Get the function return value type based on the type of the first argument.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This will call initialize(tok)!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	mutation depends on the types of nodes invloved
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Generated select expressions are already resolved nothing to do.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The path may be a reference to an alias defined in the parent query.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The HQL class alias refers to the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Associate the table alias with the element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	try the parent FromClause
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Make sure that all from elements registered with this FROM clause are actually in the AST.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Invoke setScalarColumnText on each constructor argument.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Collect the select expressions skip the first child because it is the class name.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return an empty Type array
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if there is no order by make one
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Initial load from JBC
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Find the WHERE if there is no WHERE find the FROM
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Now inject the newly built ORDER BY into the tree
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	logic operators by definition resolve to boolean.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Render the identifier select fragment using the table alias.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Class names in the FROM clause result in a JoinSequence (the old FromParser does this).
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	will still be issued when it used to be null
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Otherwise use the property mapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We ensure ASYNC semantics (JBCACHE-1175)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The standard comparator types are not Serializable but are singletons
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	ignore!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Generate implicit joins only if necessary.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the property is a special collection property name return a CollectionPropertyMapping.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Collection of components.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	construct the cache
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	local cache so we use synchronization
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We need to seed the version value as part of this bulk insert
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"make sure the lhs is ""assignable"""
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	false indicates to not generate parens around the assignment
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	currently allowed
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	in non-select queries the only time we should need to join is if we are in a subquery from clause
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return classAlias == null ? className classAlias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This is an explicit FROM element.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	swaldman 2006-08-28 define c3p0-style configuration parameters for initialPoolSize which hibernate sensibly let us default to minPoolSize but we will let users override it with the c3p0-style property if they want.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If it is not implied or it is implied and it is a many to many join where the target was not found.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we need to wrtap the param in a cast()
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Since this is an explicit FROM element it cannot be implied in the FROM clause.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Do nothing eplicit from elements are *always* in the projection list.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	propertyName refers to something like collection.size
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	property name is a sub-path of a component
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Always add the collection's query spaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	nothing to do even if the operand is a parameter no way we could infer an appropriate expected type here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Notify the FROM element that it is being referenced by the select.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	logic operators by definition resolve to booleans
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	DotNode uses null here
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We represent a from-clause alias
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are the RHS of the DOT representing a naked comp-prop-ref
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we represent a naked (simple) prop-ref
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	EARLY EXIT!!! return so the resolve call explicitly coming from DotNode can resolve this

DESIGN	Implement String += value According to the JLS value may be anything. In BeanShell we will disallow VOID (undefined) values. (or should we map them to the empty string?)
DESIGN	this should be before dockables are initialized
DESIGN	is this right?
DESIGN	should we do this for both cases above?
DESIGN	need to loosen this to any throwable do we need to handle that in interpreter somewhere? check first
DESIGN	Note this implementation is temporary. We currently keep a flat namespace of the base name of classes. i.e. BeanShell cannot be in the process of defining two classes in different packages with the same base name. To remove this limitation requires that we work through namespace imports in an analogous (or using the same path) as regular class import resolution. This workaround should handle most cases so we will try it for now.
DESIGN	"I wish I could make this ""friendly"" to only NameSpace"
DESIGN	undocumented hack to allow browser actions to work. XXX - clean up in 4.3
DESIGN	Look for a default invoke() handler method in the namespace Note this code duplicates that in NameSpace getCommand() is that ok?
DESIGN	This should be per instance
DESIGN	Can we use the proxy mechanism to cast a bsh.This to the correct interface?
DESIGN	redundant with constructor
DESIGN	Issues to resolve here 1) In which classloader should we define the class? if there is a BshClassLoader should we define it there? 2) should we use reflection to set it in a non-bsh classloader if there is one or should we always create a bsh classloader (and expose its defineClass)?
DESIGN	could refactor these a bit
DESIGN	Note This class essentially just delegates most of its methods to its parent. The setVariable() indirection is very small. We could probably fold this functionality back into the base NameSpace as a special case. But this has changed a few times so I would like to leave this abstraction for now.
DESIGN	simplified these settings a little
DESIGN	Should check for strict java here and use isJavaAssignable() instead
DESIGN	workaround for Swing rendering labels starting with using the HTML engine
DESIGN	Look for a default invoke() handler method in the namespace Note this code duplicates that in This.java should it? Call on 'This' can never be a command
DESIGN	this method is a nightmare
DESIGN	ConsoleInterface The interpreter reflexively implements the console interface that it uses. Should clean this up by using an inner class to implement the console for us.
DESIGN	Case-insensitive fs workaround
DESIGN	Wrap nulls. This is a bit of a cludge to address a deficiency in the class generator whereby it does not wrap nulls on method delegate. See Class Generator.java. If we fix that then we can remove this. (just have to generate the code there.)
DESIGN	Check for field on object Note could eliminate throwing the exception somehow
DESIGN	XXXX re-evaluate this can getSuper work by itself now? If we are a class instance and the parent is also a class instance then super means our parent.
DESIGN	I wish protected access were limited to children and not also package scope I want this to be a singleton implemented by various children.
DESIGN	Imported full name was not found as an absolute class If it is compound try to resolve to an inner class. (maybe this should happen in the BshClassManager?)
DESIGN	cannot this be combined with run() ? run seems to have stuff in it for interactive vs. non-interactive compare them side by side and see what they do differently aside from the exception handling.
DESIGN	copy and paste from bsh/classpath/ClassManagerImpl.java
DESIGN	Null value is just a declaration Note we might want to keep any existing value here instead of reset
DESIGN	Can this be factored out ? Should be be adding the L here instead?
DESIGN	Catch the mismatch and continue to try the next Note this is innefficient should have an isAssignableFrom() that does not throw
DESIGN	should use try/finally here to pop ns
DESIGN	Note this could be made clearer by adding an inner class for the cases and an object context for the child traversal.
DESIGN	hack sticking to first interpreter that resolves this see comments on type instance variable
DESIGN	Note incorrect here - we are using the hack in bsh class manager that allows lookup by base name. We need to eliminate this limitation by working through imports. See notes in class manager.
DESIGN	This is the namespace in which the method is set. It is a back-reference for the node which needs to execute under this namespace. It is not necessary to declare this transient because we can only be saved as part of our namespace anyway (currently).
DESIGN	Replace this is Cocoa API calls later
DESIGN	Scripting classes currently requires accessibility This can be eliminated with a bit more work.
DESIGN	This could be static
DESIGN	Thanks to Slava Pestov (of jEdit fame) for import caching enhancements. Note This class has gotten too big. It should be broken down a bit.
DESIGN	* * Register an attribute declaration for later retrieval. * Format * - String type * - String default value * - int value type * *TODO do something with attribute types.
DESIGN	TODO to get cast and boxing working e.g. e.g. Byte [] ia = { 1 2 } If the baseType is a wrapper type then we need to get the primitive TYPE class for the base type here in order for the cast to allow it Then boxing will happen naturally in the Array.set(). e.g. Integer [] ia = { 1 2 }
DESIGN	Note We will ll move this behavior out to a subclass of NameSpace but we will start here.
DESIGN	This is a particularly nasty bit of code that checks for a parameter entity reference but peeks ahead to catch the '%' in parameter entity declarations.
DESIGN	Should cache this subject to classloader change message Evaluation of the formal parameter simply resolves its type via the specified namespace.. it does not modify the namespace.
DESIGN	Notes It would not be hard to eliminate the use of org.objectweb.asm.Type from this class making the distribution a tiny bit smaller.
DESIGN	fucking GTK look and feel
DESIGN	stupid caret will automatically be incremented
DESIGN	Spacing workaround
DESIGN	I do not know of any other way to fix this since invoking this command from a menu results in the focus owner being the menu until the menu goes away.
DESIGN	a little hack for reverse replace and find
DESIGN	Static methods that operate on compound ('.' separated) names I guess we could move these to StringUtil someday
DESIGN	Note which of these things should be checked at parse time vs. run time?
DESIGN	Windows bug workaround in case a YES/NO confirm was shown
DESIGN	clear name resolvers do not know if this is necessary.
DESIGN	I am too tired to think of a better way to handle this right now.
DESIGN	hacked BufferIORequest to send VFSUpdates in case two stage save is off now
DESIGN	some other primitive should avoid calling methods on primitive as we do in Name (cannot treat primitive like an object message) but the hole is useful right now.
DESIGN	Change the parent (which was the class static) to the class instance We really need to check if we are a static inner class here first but for some reason Java will not show the static modifier on our fake inner classes could generate a flag field.
DESIGN	this is where checked exceptions piss me off. this method only uses a StringReader which can never throw an exception
DESIGN	If any subexpressions did not terminate they do not count TODO check if this code ever gets hit
DESIGN	Parse pattern into tokens. Does anyone know if it is more efficient to use char[] than a String.charAt()? I am assuming so.
DESIGN	Note object is only used here for precondition get rid of it?
DESIGN	Why both of these?
DESIGN	Cut off from parent we must have our own class manager. cannot do this in the run() command (needs to resolve stuff) Should we do it by default when we create a namespace will no parent of class manager?
DESIGN	Note the bsh command code should probably not be here we need to scope it by the namespace that imported the command so it probably needs to be integrated into NameSpace.
DESIGN	This could be smarter
DESIGN	It was explicitly imported but we do not know what it is. should we throw an error here??
DESIGN	Note we need a form of eval that passes the callstack through
DESIGN	Primary interpreter set and get variable methods Note These are squeltching errors should they?
DESIGN	Workaround for JDK bug 4071281 where system.in.available() returns too large a value. This bug has been fixed in JDK 1.2.
DESIGN	Somewhat of a hack. If the special fields are visible (we are operating relative to a 'this' type already) dissallow further .this references to prevent user from skipping to things like super.this.caller
DESIGN	Should clean this up to a single return statement
DESIGN	Implementation notes Note we may need some synchronization in here Note on version dependency This base class is JDK 1.1 compatible however we are forced to use weak references in the full featured implementation (the optional bsh.classpath package) to accomodate all of the fleeting namespace listeners as they fall out of scope. (NameSpaces must be informed if the class space changes so that they can un-cache names). Perhaps a simpler idea would be to have entities that reference cached types always perform a light weight check with a counter / reference value and use that to detect changes in the namespace. This puts the burden on the consumer to check at appropriate times but could eliminate the need for the listener system in many places and the necessity of weak references in this package.
DESIGN	Note this impor pattern is becoming common could factor it out into an importedObject Vector class.
DESIGN	not sure if we should really recurse here for explicitly imported class in parent
DESIGN	The following two boolean checks were tacked on. This could probably be smoothed out.
DESIGN	Notes This is broken. It finds public but less specific methods over non-public but more specific ones. findMostSpecficMethod() needs to be rewritten to eliminate findAccessibleMethod. We should implement the findMostSpecificMethod that uses the publicOnly flag. FindMostSpecificMethod should also operate in two passes to give standard Java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches.
DESIGN	{{{ UnixWorkaround constructor
DESIGN	drag and drop support I would just move the code to JEditTextArea but it depends on JDK 1.4 APIs
DESIGN	next version remove this
DESIGN	compatibility kludge for jEdit 3.1 and earlier
DESIGN	AHA! this is probably the only way to fix this
DESIGN	this is a dirty hack and it relies on the fact that updates for parents are sent before updates for the changed nodes themselves (if this was not the case the browser would not be updated properly on delete etc). to avoid causing '> 1 request' errors do not reload directory if request already active
DESIGN	we consume this to work around the bug where A+TAB window switching activates the menu bar on Windows.
DESIGN	I guess translated events do not have the 'evt' field set so consuming will not work. I do not think this is a problem as nothing uses translation anyway
DESIGN	this is a hack and really needs to be done better.

DESIGN	This does not seem very correct but it fixes a problem when setting the initial caret position for a buffer (eg from the recent file list)
DESIGN	do not try this at home
DESIGN	silly that we reference the vertical scroll bar here directly. we do this so that the horizontal scroll bar is flush with the vertical scroll bar
DESIGN	XXX clean up this conditional
DESIGN	Temporary hack to support inner classes If the obj is a non-static inner class then import the context This is not a sufficient emulation of inner classes. Replace this later
DESIGN	workaround for Swing's annoying processing of labels starting with which often breaks
DESIGN	fucking GTK look and feel!
DESIGN	hack so that 'select all' does not change current buffer
DESIGN	if an occurence occurs at the beginning of the selection the selection start will get moved. this sucks so we hack to avoid it.
DESIGN	Silly bug workaround 8694. If you look at the above code * note that we restore the saved caret position first then * scroll to the saved location. However the caret changing * can itself result in scrolling to a different location than * what was saved and since moveCaretPosition() calls * updateBracketHighlight() the bracket highlight's out of * bounds calculation will rely on a different set of physical * first/last lines than what we will end up with eventually. * Instead of confusing the user with status messages that * appear at random when switching buffers we simply hide the * message altogether.
DESIGN	"this is a sloppy hack to fix bug ""[ 677902 ] hitting return after collapsed fold"" the idea is that if we extend the range then the problem described in the bug happends so if the insert is at the very end of the range we do not extend it instead we push the insert into the next range however for this to work properly we also have to mess with screen line counts."
DESIGN	need this bullshit scroll bar policy for the preferred size hack to work
DESIGN	XXX if we keep the createClassManager in getClassManager then we can axe this?
DESIGN	Note This class is messy. The method and field resolution need to be rewritten. Various methods in here catch NoSuchMethod or NoSuchField exceptions during their searches. These should be rewritten to avoid having to catch the exceptions. Method lookups are now cached at a high level so they are less important however the logic is messy.
DESIGN	the sooner ppl move to the new api the less we will need crap like this

DESIGN	"Strip off drive letters! REVIEW Would a better check be ""(File.separator == '\')""?"
DESIGN	Workaround for uncooperative Windows L&F
DESIGN	have to do this hack until VFSPath class is written
DESIGN	stupid Swing
DESIGN	none of the others are ever meant to be removed. retarded eh? this needs to be fixed eventually for plugins might want to do weird stuff to jEdit's UI
DESIGN	this is retarded. excuse me while I drool and make stupid noises
DESIGN	stupid scrollbar policy is an attempt to work around bugs people have been seeing with IBM's JDK -- 7 Sep 2000
DESIGN	retarded GTK look and feel!
DESIGN	should probably error
DESIGN	there must be a better way of fixing this the problem is that this method can sometimes be called as a result of a text area scroll event in which case the caret position has not been updated yet.
DESIGN	Perhaps here we would want to guard with a property for parallel backups or not.
DESIGN	while this might be questionable some menus depend on properties
DESIGN	Get available screens O(n^3) this is nasty but since we are not dealling with many items it should be fine
DESIGN	{{{ Methods that really should not be public
DESIGN	{{{ UnixWorkaround class
DESIGN	Perhaps if Xerces was not slightly brain-damaged we would not need this
DESIGN	this is a weird hack. we do not want C+e a to insert 'a' in the search bar if the search bar has focus
DESIGN	moved to GUIUtilities as it makes no sense being here.
DESIGN	Hack need a more direct way of obtaining a view? JEditTextArea.getView() method?
DESIGN	REVIEW How do we resolve this discrepancy?!

DESIGN	First try for an accessible version of the exact match. This first lookup seems redundant with below but is apparently needed. This whole thing is messy.
DESIGN	work around for broken FTP plugin!
DESIGN	hack to move the spaces to the front
DESIGN	This feels sloppy especially for non-you.S. locales.
DESIGN	hack to get fixed length 'length' field
DESIGN	We have to deal with assembly!!! The programmer can be writing little 32 byte chunks for all we know and we must assemble complete records for writing. REVIEW Maybe this should be in TarBuffer? Could that help to eliminate some of the buffer copying.
DESIGN	Hack done to fix bringing the window to the front. At least on windows Frame.toFront() does not cut it. Remove the isWindows check if it is broken under other OSes too.
DESIGN	This method should be rewritten to use getFields() and avoid catching exceptions during the search.
DESIGN	hack
DESIGN	this is such a bad way of doing it but oh well
DESIGN	This should probably be in Reflect.java
DESIGN	Notes See notes on findMostSpecificMethod. This method should be rolled into findMostSpecificMethod.
DESIGN	"Note is using SignatureKey in this way dangerous? In the pathological case a user could eat up memory caching every possible combination of argument types to an untyped method. Maybe we could be smarter about it by ignoring the types of untyped parameter positions? The method resolver could return a set of ""hints"" for the signature key caching? There is also the overhead of creating one of these for every method dispatched. What is the alternative?"
DESIGN	crusty workaround
DESIGN	workaround for A+keys producing * garbage on Windows
DESIGN	addToFavorites() which is a static method * (for convinience) needs an instance of the * VFS to pass to VFSManager.sendVFSUpdate() * hence this hack.
DESIGN	Allow getThis() to work through BlockNameSpace to the method namespace XXX re-eval this do we need it?
DESIGN	"these are used to eliminate code duplication. i do not normally use the visitor or ""template method"" pattern but this code was contributed by Peter Cox and i do not feel like changing it around too much."
DESIGN	switch eats a multi-level break here? not empty statement
DESIGN	this part sucks
DESIGN	stupid hack to handle referencing a rule set that is defined later!
DESIGN	JDK 1.4 workaround
DESIGN	fuck me dead
DESIGN	should the next two be public maybe?
DESIGN	stupidity
DESIGN	Note this method and resolveExpectedJavaField should be rewritten to invert this logic so that no exceptions need to be caught unecessarily. This is just a temporary impl. @return the field or null if not found
DESIGN	Note we need a singleton here so that things like 'this == this' work (and probably a good idea for speed). Caching a single instance here seems technically incorrect considering the declaringInterpreter could be different under some circumstances. (Case a child interpreter running a source() / eval() command ). However the effect is just that the main interpreter that executes your script should be the one involved in call-backs from Java. I do not know if there are corner cases where a child interpreter would be the first to use a This reference in a namespace or if that would even because any problems if it did We could do some experiments to find out and if necessary we could cache on a per interpreter basis if we had weak references We might also look at skipping over child interpreters and going to the parent for the declaring interpreter so we would be sure to get the top interpreter.
DESIGN	Resolve relative to a class type static field inner class ?
DESIGN	some regexps (eg ^ by itself) have a length == 0 so we implement this hack. if you do not understand what is going on here then go back to watching MTV
DESIGN	Optimization - If classOfStaticMethod is set then we have already been here and determined that this is a static method invocation. Note maybe factor this out with path below clean up.
DESIGN	this will probably not get used Object type
DESIGN	Windows JDK workaround
DESIGN	this listener priority thing is a bad hack
DESIGN	This does not look pretty and mode line should * probably be split up into seperate * components/strings
DESIGN	this is stupid and misleading. * but 'path' is not used anywhere except * the above line and if this is done * after the 'continue' then we will * either hang or be forced to duplicate * it inside the buffer == null or add * a 'finally' clause. you decide which one's * worse.
DESIGN	workaround for hang if match was * zero-width. not sure if there is * a better way to handle this
DESIGN	XXX magic number
DESIGN	On Windows paths of the form X list the last *working * directory* on that drive. To list the root of the drive * you must use X\. * * However the VFS browser and friends strip off trailing * path separators for various reasons. So to work around * that we add a '\' to drive letter paths on Windows.
DESIGN	On Unix set permissions of port file to rw------- so that on broken Unices which give everyone read access to user home dirs people cannot see your port file (and hence send arbitriary BeanShell code your way. Nasty.)
DESIGN	??? this should only be called with fully loaded action set
DESIGN	broken Eclipse workaround! 24 Febuary 2004
DESIGN	Notes This is broken. It finds public but less specific methods over non-public but more specific ones. This method needs to be rewritten to eliminate findAccessibleMethod. We should implement the findMostSpecificMethod that uses the publicOnly flag. FindMostSpecificMethod should also operate in two passes to give standard Java assignable matches priority over extended bsh type matches.
DESIGN	XXX This should not be hardcoded
DESIGN	INTERVAL OPERATOR {x} | {x} | {xy} (RE_INTERVALS && RE_NO_BK_BRACES) \{x\} | \{x\} | \{xy\} (RE_INTERVALS && !RE_NO_BK_BRACES) OPEN QUESTION what is proper interpretation of '{' at start of string?
DESIGN	XXX does this really belong here?
DESIGN	We do need to save every possible point but the number of clone() invocations here is really a killer for performance on non-stingy repeat operators. I am open to suggestions
DESIGN	Note this should really just throw NoSuchFieldException need to change related signatures and code.
DESIGN	Split the methods into constructors and regular method lists
IMPLEMENTATION	need to add static block here

IMPLEMENTATION	TODO Also check REG_ANCHORINDEX vs. anchor
IMPLEMENTATION	skip header bytes maybe should check if they are valid or not?
IMPLEMENTATION	Debug utils are static so that they are reachable by code that does not necessarily have an interpreter reference (e.g. tracing in utils). In the future we may want to allow debug/trace to be turned on on a per interpreter basis in which case we will need to use the parent reference in some way to determine the scope of the command that turns it on or off.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"1st step As explained above resizing an instruction may require to resize another one which may require to resize yet another one and so on. The first step of the algorithm consists in finding all the instructions that need to be resized without modifying the code. This is done by the following ""fix point"" algorithm - parse the code to find the jump instructions whose offset will need more than 2 bytes to be stored (the future offset is computed from the current offset and from the number of bytes that will be inserted or removed between the source and target instructions). For each such instruction adds an entry in (a copy of) the indexes and sizes arrays (if this has not already been done in a previous iteration!) - if at least one entry has been added during the previous step go back to the beginning otherwise stop. In fact the real algorithm is complicated by the fact that the size of TABLESWITCH and LOOKUPSWITCH instructions depends on their position in the bytecode (because of padding). In order to ensure the convergence of the algorithm the number of bytes to be added or removed from these instructions is over estimated during the previous loop and computed exactly only after the loop is finished (this requires another pass to parse the bytecode of the method)."

If it is an LHS resolve to a value. Note The ambiguous name construct is now necessary where the node may be an ambiguous name. If this becomes common we might want to make a static method nodeToObject() or something. The point is that we cannot just eval() - we need to direct the evaluation to the context sensitive type of result namely object class etc.

DESIGN	TODO implement properly
DESIGN	TODO this must be wrong
DESIGN	TODO we did not check the width yet
DESIGN	hack to ensure the newly created awt fonts will be rendered with the same height as the swt one
DESIGN	TODO shift block right by half
DESIGN	TODO shift block over to right
DESIGN	TODO find a better localization key
DESIGN	FIXME implement this low priority
DESIGN	FIXME the XYItemRenderer interface does not specify the getAnnotations() method but it should
DESIGN	calculate the adjusted data area taking into account the 3D effect this assumes that there is a 3D renderer all this 3D effect is a bit of an ugly hack
DESIGN	TODO add constructors for combinations of number and date formatters.
DESIGN	TODO move to plot state
DESIGN	TO DO these annotations only work with XYPlot see if it is possible to make ContourPlot a subclass of XYPlot (DG)
DESIGN	FIXME we should really assert a value
DESIGN	TODO to be implemented
DESIGN	do we need to update the crosshair values?
DESIGN	TODO fix output when this flag is set to true
DESIGN	TODO for now we are ignoring the height constraint
DESIGN	TODO move the above to the plot state
DESIGN	FIXME this code means that it is not possible to use more than one domain axis for the combined plots
DESIGN	not strictly necessary since the renderer set for the parent plot is not used
DESIGN	end of workaround
DESIGN	TODO could change this to itemFillPaint(). For backwards compatibility it might require a useFillPaint flag.
DESIGN	TODO this attribute should be transferred to the renderer state.
DESIGN	TODO In JFreeChart 1.2.0 put this method in the CategoryItemRenderer interface
DESIGN	TODO rotate the image when drawn with horizontal orientation?
DESIGN	FIXME this should generate a series change event
DESIGN	FIXME the renderer interface does not have the drawDomainLine() method so we have to rely on the renderer being a subclass of AbstractXYItemRenderer (which is lame)
DESIGN	TODO by coding the event with some information about what changed in the dataset we could make the recalculation of the interval more efficient in some cases (for instance if the change is just an update to a y-value then the x-interval does not need updating)
DESIGN	the method we want is not in the CategoryItemRenderer interface
DESIGN	FIXME what if value is null on next line?
DESIGN	hack to ensure the newly created swt fonts will be rendered with the same height as the awt one
DESIGN	unused but must return something so while we are at it
DESIGN	a redraw should NOT trigger another change event
DESIGN	FIXME perhaps we should clone the data list
DESIGN	if we are rendering the values as percentages we need to calculate the total for the current item. Unfortunately here we end up repeating the calculation more times than is strictly necessary - hopefully I will come back to this and find a way to add the total(s) to the renderer state. The other problem is we implicitly assume the dataset has no negative values perhaps that can be fixed too.
DESIGN	Note It would be nice to pre-calculate this per series
DESIGN	we assume that all other Paint instances implement equals() and hashCode() of course that might not be true but what can we do about it?
DESIGN	FIXME use other fields too
DESIGN	all attributes are immutable so we can just return the super.clone() FIXME in fact the generator itself is immutable so cloning is not necessary
DESIGN	here is a quirk - the API has been defined in terms of a plain TimePeriod which cannot make use of the timezone and locale specified in the constructor so we only do the time zone pegging if the period is an instanceof RegularTimePeriod
DESIGN	now handle specific plot types (and yes I know this is some really ugly code that has to be manually updated any time a new plot type is added - I should have written something much cooler but I did not and neither did anyone else).
DESIGN	TODO URLEncode?
DESIGN	CREATE ENTITIES FIXME these methods should be defined
DESIGN	TODO Revert to SVN revision 2469 in JFreeChart 1.0.16 (MultipleGradientPaint's / JDK issues) TODO THEN change visibility of ALL darker( ) Methods EXCEPT darker(Paint) to private!
DESIGN	TODO replace getSize by getBounds ?
DESIGN	TODO check threshold
DESIGN	FIXME add setBaseItemURLGenerator(CategoryURLGenerator boolean) ?
DESIGN	unused in parent
DESIGN	FIXME add setSeriesItemURLGenerator(int CategoryURLGenerator boolean)?
DESIGN	now we handle some special cases - yes UGLY code alert!
DESIGN	FIXME it probably makes sense to allocate an array of 256 Colors and lazily populate this array
DESIGN	TODO need to fetch this from localised resources
DESIGN	FIXME No getValueFormat() method?
DESIGN	here we could probably be a little faster by searching for both indices simultaneously but I will look at that later if it seems like it matters
DESIGN	TODO complete this
DESIGN	FIXME we should really assert a value here
DESIGN	FIXME Clone the attributed string if it is not null
DESIGN	TODO implement this method properly
DESIGN	this may be obsolete (not used anywhere)
DESIGN	/ a kludge to make everything work when no rows returned
DESIGN	here we tweak the notify flag on the plot so that only one notification happens even though we update multiple axes
DESIGN	report this?
DESIGN	TODO shift block down by half
DESIGN	TODO is this a good idea?
DESIGN	FIXME better ask the renderer instead of DatasetUtilities
DESIGN	TODO implement the entity for the annotation
DESIGN	TODO this needs to move into the renderer state
DESIGN	needs to be improved !!!
DESIGN	not used by plot
DESIGN	FIXME this attribute is never used - deprecate?
DESIGN	FIXME need a locale as well as a timezone
DESIGN	TODO implement this properly
DESIGN	TODO For JFreeChart 1.2.0 this method should go in the ShapeUtilities class
DESIGN	we will have to use the method in the interface but this does not have the paint and stroke settings
DESIGN	TODO it might be a good idea to keep a reference to the color specified in setPaint() or setColor() rather than creating a new object every time getPaint() is called.
DESIGN	FIXME Check that there is not already a series with the same key
DESIGN	I know it is bad to create object. better idea?
DESIGN	FIXME clone generator
DESIGN	TODO use a generator here
DESIGN	FIXME this attribute is not used - deprecate?
DESIGN	defer argument checking
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO I think we need to make sure the keys are actually cloned whereas the paint instances are always immutable so they are OK
IMPLEMENTATION	FIXME draw outliers

DEFECT	TODO we loose encoding information here fix it
DEFECT	TODO Numeric.new works in Ruby and it does here too. However trying to use that instance in a numeric operation should generate an ArgumentError. Doing this seems so pathological I do not see the need to fix this now.
DEFECT	"TODO Adding implicit nils caused multiple problems in compiler -- revist after landing assert bodyNode != null ""bodyNode is not null"""
DEFECT	TODO take BigDecimal.mode into account.
DEFECT	FIXME for some reason this dispatcher causes a VerifyError classClass.dispatcher = callbackFactory.createDispatcher(classClass)
DEFECT	FIXME I doubt any of the constants referenced in this method are ever redefined -- should compare to the known values rather than do an expensive constant lookup.
DEFECT	"TODO Rewriter and compiler assume case when empty expression. In MRI this is just a when. assert caseNode != null ""caseNode is not null"""
DEFECT	XXX Wrong but will have to do for now
DEFECT	IMPORTANT Receive the block argument before the opt and splat args This is so that the *arg can be encoded as 'rest of the array'. This will not work if the block argument has not been received yet!
DEFECT	FIXME I got a bunch of NPEs when I did not check for nulls here HOW?!
DEFECT	SSS FIXME There are also differences in variable scoping between 1.8 and 1.9 Ruby 1.8 is the buggy semantics if I understand correctly. The semantics of how this shadows other variables outside the block needs to be figured out during live var analysis.
DEFECT	This was a getOpt with one mandatory arg but it did not work so I am parsing it for now.
DEFECT	"This is the result of a bug that left off all trailing arguments. E.g. system ""ls"" ""-1"" ""dir"" would be seen as system ""ls"""
DEFECT	TODO We overflow on large files We could increase to long to limit this but then the impl gets more involved since java io APIs based on int (means we have to chunk up a long into a series of int ops).
DEFECT	If we outgrow our pushback stack then grow it (this should only happen in pretty pathological cases).
DEFECT	FIXME Arg may also be true false and nil and still be valid. Strangely enough protocol conversion is not happening in Ruby on this arg?
DEFECT	TODO proper sign
DEFECT	TODO In MRI 1.9 an explicit check for negative length is added here. IndexError is raised when length is negative. See [ruby-core12953] for more details. New note This is actually under re-evaluation see [ruby-core17483].
DEFECT	FIXME if we terminate immediately this appears to break while in method arguments we need to push a nil for the cases where we will never enter the body
DEFECT	The following constants capture pre-known static call sites -- JRuby implementations of methods of ruby classes SSS FIXME Note that compiler/impl/BaseBodyCompiler is using op_match2 for match() and and op_match for match2 Is this a bug there?
DEFECT	SSS FIXME This does not preserve original order of when clauses. We could consider preserving the order (or maybe not since we would have to sort the constants first in any case) for outputing jump tables in certain situations. add body to map for emitting later
DEFECT	"SSS FIXME Why is the for node being built using closures and not as a ""regular"" loop with branches? This has implications on inlining implementations of closures next break etc. When ""each"" and the block it consumes are inlined together in the caller the ""loop"" from the each should become a normal loop without any closures. But in this implementation of for we replace one closure with another!"
DEFECT	synchronized method per JRUBY-1173 (unsafe Double-Checked Locking) FIXME synchronization is still wrong in CP code
DEFECT	vulture thread will periodically expunge dead entries. entries are also expunged during 'put' operations this is designed to cover the case where many objects are created initially followed by limited put activity. FIXME DISABLED (below) pending resolution of finalization issue
DEFECT	FIXME We are assuming that original string will be raw bytes. If -Ku is provided this will not be true but that is ok for now. Deal with that when someone needs it.
DEFECT	TODO Rubicon TestKernel dies without this line. A cursory glance implies we falsely set $! to nil and this sets it back to something valid. This should get fixed at the same time we address bug 1296484.
DEFECT	MRI 1.8 behavior this combination of flags is not allowed
DEFECT	zero args with block FIXME omit args index subtract one from normal block index
DEFECT	FIXME It may be possible to killpg on systems which support it. POSIX library needs to tell whether a particular method works or not
DEFECT	TODO This code effectively disables all inspection-based optimizations none of them are 100% safe yet
DEFECT	FIXME No argument seems to work for -K in MRI plus this should not siphon off additional args 'jruby -K ~/scripts/foo'. Also better error processing.
DEFECT	We are in eval with binding break out early FIXME This is broken with the new backtrace stuff
DEFECT	FIXME This is a system error based on errno
DEFECT	TODO make sure it is really safe to not to copy it
DEFECT	FIXME not correct exception
DEFECT	FIXME We cannot guarantee this will always be a RubyIO so the old code here is not safe
DEFECT	dump the trace and continue this is currently only here for Android which seems to have bugs in its enumeration logic
DEFECT	FIXME Add at_exit and finalizers to exit then make exit_bang not call those.
DEFECT	"TODO need to isolate the ""current"" thread from class creation"
DEFECT	XXX actually only on windows
DEFECT	Enebo Should ~frogger\\foo work (it does not in linux ruby)?
DEFECT	FIXME cannot use static would interfere with other runtimes in the same JVM
DEFECT	TODO anything threads attached to original fd are notified of the close see rb_thread_fd_close
DEFECT	TODO This is an freopen in MRI this is close but not quite the same
DEFECT	TODO Ruby locks the string here
DEFECT	FIXME check how ruby 1.9 handles this
DEFECT	TODO full-precision divmod is 1000x slower than MRI!
DEFECT	FIXME I am not sure this is right but the old code returned the undef which definitely is not right
DEFECT	ENEBO Very wrong
DEFECT	FIXME MRI has special case for constants here
DEFECT	FIXME Throw the right ArgumentError's if the class is missing or if it is a module.
DEFECT	TODO We should use implicit nil for body but problem (punt til later)
DEFECT	* * Get value from current scope or one of its captured scopes. * * FIXME block variables are not getting primed to nil so we need to null check those * until we prime them properly. Also add assert back in. * * @param offset zero-indexed value that represents where variable lives * @param depth how many captured scopes down this variable should be set * @return the value here
DEFECT	FIXME -x flag not supported case 'x' break
DEFECT	FIXME This is causing a verification error for some reason nilClass.dispatcher = callbackFactory.createDispatcher(nilClass)
DEFECT	Walk up the scope tree right now as much as possible to avoid run-time walking SSS FIXME Any reason why this might break in the presence of ruby's dynamic resolution? What might break?
DEFECT	FIXME Errno descriptions from Constantine on Windows are not useful at the moment.
DEFECT	FIXME this should reset to what it was before
DEFECT	SSS FIXME Incorect!
DEFECT	FIXME vulture daemon thread prevents finalization find alternative approach. vulture.start()
DEFECT	"FIXME this seems like a good assertion but it breaks compiled code and the code seems to run without it assert currentModule != null ""cannot push null RubyClass"""
DEFECT	SSS FIXME For constant arrays we should never get here!
DEFECT	FIXME This is wrong
DEFECT	FIXME may need to broaden for IPV6 IP address strings
DEFECT	TODO sys fail
DEFECT	* Are there are available data flow facts to run this problem? SSS FIXME Silly optimization?
DEFECT	SSS FIXME Verify semantics of this instruction
DEFECT	FIXME This is not quite right it should not evaluate the value if it is going to throw the error
DEFECT	TODO full-precision remainder is 1000x slower than MRI!
DEFECT	FIXME Broken but behaving
DEFECT	TODO do not require pop
DESIGN	we basically ignore protocol. let someone report it
DESIGN	FIXME I use a for block to implement END node because we need a proc which captures its enclosing scope. ForBlock now represents these node and should be renamed.
DESIGN	SSS FIXME 1. Is the ordering correct? (poll before next)
DESIGN	We use a highly uncommon string to represent the paragraph delimiter (100% soln not worth it)
DESIGN	"add a ""self"" recv here TODO is this right?"
DESIGN	"TODO MRI behavior Call ""+"" or ""add"" depending on the call. But this leads to exceptions when Floats are added. See return callCoerced(context op b true) -- this is MRI behavior. we will use ours for now thus providing an ability to add Floats."
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Is this correctly placed at the end of the loop iteration?
DESIGN	"TODO Ruby reuses this logic for other ""write"" behavior by checking if it is an IO and calling write again"
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Where does this go? m.setLinePosition(arrayNode.getPosition())
DESIGN	it would be nice (and logical!) if exponent form behaved like E/e and decimal form behaved like f but no such luck. hence
DESIGN	SSS FIXME These should get normally compiled or initialized some other way SSS FIXME Parent/super-type info is incorrect! These are just placeholders for now .. this needs to be updated with *real* class objects later!
DESIGN	SSS FIXME I could make IR_Loop a scope too semantically it is a scope but functionally not sure if this is required yet
DESIGN	this covers the rare case of lower-case class names (and thus will fail 99.999% of the time). fortunately we will only do this once per package name. (and seriously folks look into best practices )
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Should this be a string literal or a string? Dummy class for the script
DESIGN	TODO should this be deprecated ? (to be efficient internals should deal with RubyHash directly)
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Does int suffice or do we need long?
DESIGN	modules are included with a shim class we must find that shim to handle super() appropriately
DESIGN	Reset value map if this instruction is the start/end of a basic block Right now calls are considered hard boundaries for optimization and information cannot be propagated across them! SSS FIXME Rather than treat all calls with a broad brush what we need is to capture different attributes about a call - uses closures - known call target - can modify scope - etc. This information is probably already present in the AST Inspector
DESIGN	TODO Determine whether we should perhaps store non-singleton class in the implementationClass
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Correct? Where does closure arg come from?
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Should I have a reference to the IR_loop that is being retried?
DESIGN	temporary hack to handle non-Ruby values will come up with better solution shortly
DESIGN	Simplify the variables too -- to keep these variables in sync with what is actually used in the when clauses This is not required for correctness reasons but only for performance reasons.
DESIGN	Must be called from main thread (it is currently but this bothers me)
DESIGN	CON FIXME I do not know how to make case be an expression does that logic need to go here?
DESIGN	Something wrong we do not know the cwd TODO Is this behavior really desirable? /mov
DESIGN	TODO no java stringity
DESIGN	FIXME Total hack to get flash in Rails marshalling/unmarshalling in session ok We need to totally change marshalling to work with overridden core classes.
DESIGN	TODO this method is not present in MRI!
DESIGN	FIXME Ideally JavaObject instances should be marshallable which means that the JavaObject metaclass should have an appropriate allocator. JRUBY-414
DESIGN	TODO public only?
DESIGN	FIXME This should probably do some translation from Ruby priority levels to Java priority levels (until we have green threads)
DESIGN	TODO Consider a better way of synchronizing
DESIGN	using IOInputStream may not be the most performance way but it is easy.
DESIGN	FIXME We should not be regenerating this over and over
DESIGN	"XXX This check previously used callMethod(""=="") to check for equality between classes when scanning the hierarchy. However the == check may be safe we should only ever have one instance bound to a given type/constant. If it is found to be unsafe examine ways to avoid the == call."
DESIGN	TODO why are we duplicating the constants here and then in FileConstants below? FileConstants is included in IO.
DESIGN	A cloned method now belongs to a new class. Set it. TODO Make DynamicMethod immutable
DESIGN	TODO These were missing so we are not handling them elsewhere?
DESIGN	FIXME wtf is this? Why would these use the class?
DESIGN	TODO Figure out how this can happen and possibly remove
DESIGN	FIXME I do not like this
DESIGN	FIXME these descriptions should probably be moved out to Constantine project which deals with all platform-dependent constants.
DESIGN	FIXME this below is temporary but its much safer for COW (it prevents not shared Strings with begin != 0) this allows now e.g. ByteListset not to be begin aware
DESIGN	TODO what about n arg?
DESIGN	FIXME I think this chunk is equivalent to MRI id2name (and not our public method id2name). Make into method if used more than once.
DESIGN	TODO cache?
DESIGN	FIXME This is probably not very efficient since it loads all methods for each call
DESIGN	Hack in to replace usual readline with this
DESIGN	TODO this is kind of gross
DESIGN	FIXME In order for Thread to play well with the standard 'new' behavior it must provide an allocator that can create empty object instances which initialize then fills with appropriate data.
DESIGN	these extra arrays are really unfortunate split some of these paths out to eliminate?
DESIGN	if not overloaded we add a method that guesses at which signature to use TODO just adding first one right now add in signature-guessing logic
DESIGN	SSS FIXME This should never get called for constant svalues
DESIGN	* TODO This version is better than the hackish previous one. Windows * behavior needs to be defined though. I suppose this version * could be improved more too. * TODO /etc/passwd is also inadequate for MacOSX since it does not * use /etc/passwd for regular user accounts
DESIGN	FIXME there is some code duplication here with RubyObjectinspect
DESIGN	FIXME figure out why we get null sometimes
DESIGN	Hacky Advance position to eat newline here .
DESIGN	need to reexamine this
DESIGN	Workaround for JRUBY-4149
DESIGN	using IOOutputStream may not be the most performance way but it is easy.
DESIGN	ENEBO Lots of optz in 1.9 parser here
DESIGN	FIXME move out of this class!
DESIGN	IN FACT we should probably raise an error yes?
DESIGN	TODO get rid of this (lax returns 0.0 strict will throw)
DESIGN	bit risky if someone changes completor but useful for method calls
DESIGN	TODO the rest of this seeking to same position is unnecessary since we share a channel but some of this may be needed?
DESIGN	TODO is this the right thing to do?
DESIGN	FIXME this probably belongs in a different package.
DESIGN	We clone dynamic scope because this will be a new instance of a block. Any previously captured instances of this block may still be around and we do not want to start overwriting those values when we create a new one. ENEBO Once we make self lastClass and lastMethod immutable we can remove duplicate
DESIGN	TODO is this correct ?
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Do we need to check if l is same as whatever popped?
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Where is this set up? How is this diff from ClassVarDeclNode??
DESIGN	Fixme Do we need the check or does Main.java not call this they should consolidate
DESIGN	FIXME This table will get moved into POSIX library so we can get all actual supported signals. This is a quick fix to support basic signals until that happens.
DESIGN	FIXME This worries me a bit since it could allocate a lot with a large newLength
DESIGN	TODO This filtering is kind of gross it would be nice to get some parser help here
DESIGN	This is GROSS but Java API's are not ISO 8601 compliant at all
DESIGN	FIXME Get rid of laziness and handle restricted access elsewhere
DESIGN	TODO for now we use a faithful reimplementation of MRI's algorithm but should use UTF8Encoding facilities from Joni once it starts prefroming UTF-8 content validation.
DESIGN	FIXME Determine if a real allocator is needed here. Do people want to extend JavaClass? Do we want them to do that? Can you Class.new(JavaClass)? Should you be able to? TODO NOT_ALLOCATABLE_ALLOCATOR is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it cannot be marshalled. Confirm. JRUBY-415
DESIGN	grrr arghh want to subclass sun.misc.FloatingDecimal but cannot so we must do all this (the next 70 lines of code) which has already been done by FloatingDecimal.
DESIGN	FIXME do we really want 'declared' methods? includes private/protected and does _not_ include superclass methods. also the getDeclared calls may throw SecurityException if we are running under a restrictive security policy.
DESIGN	small hack to save a cast later on
DESIGN	there is not a compelling reason to keep JavaClass instances in a weak map (any proxies created are [were] kept in a non-weak map so in most cases they will stick around anyway) and some good reasons not to (JavaClass creation is expensive for one many lookups are performed when passing parameters to/from methods etc.). TODO faster custom concurrent map
DESIGN	TODO check for Java reserved names and raise exception if encountered
DESIGN	FIXME JRUBY-3188 ends up with condition returning null quick fix until I can dig into it
DESIGN	Workaround for a bug in Sun's JDK 1.5.x see
DESIGN	FIXME weakref.rb also does caller(2) here for the backtrace
DESIGN	FIXME Remove this from grammars.
DESIGN	TODO it is perhaps just a coincidence that all the channels for which we should raise are instanceof SelectableChannel since stdio is not so this bothers me slightly. -CON
DESIGN	"FIXME Not sure what the semantics of transfer are cFiber.defineFastMethod(""transfer"" cb.getFastOptMethod(""transfer""))"
DESIGN	FIXME This is pretty gross we should have a cleaner initialization that does not depend on package-visible fields and ideally is atomic probably using an immutable structure we replace all at once. lazy null when no groups defined
DESIGN	This is a dummy scope we should find a way to make that more explicit
DESIGN	FIXME Resolve what the hell is going on
DESIGN	FIXME Maybe not best place but move it to a good home
DESIGN	TODO NOT_ALLOCATABLE_ALLOCATOR may be ok here but it is unclear how Structs work with marshalling. Confirm behavior and ensure we are doing this correctly. JRUBY-415
DESIGN	We always prepend an org.jruby.proxy package to the beginning because java and javax packages are protected and signed jars prevent us generating new classes with those package names. See JRUBY-2439.
DESIGN	TODO we should be able to optimize this quite a bit post-1.0. JavaClass already has all the methods organized by method name the next version (supporting protected methods/fields) will have them organized even further. So collectMethods here can just lookup the overridden methods in the JavaClass map should be much faster.
DESIGN	TODO make more efficient by not creating IRubyArray[]
DESIGN	* rb_mod_remove_cvar * * FIXME any good reason to have two identical methods? (same as remove_class_variable)
DESIGN	from DUP_SETUP rb_copy_generic_ivar from DUP_SETUP here unlikely..
DESIGN	"if we do not have opt args start after args (they will be assigned later) this is for crap like def foo(a = (b = true 1)) which numbers b before a FIXME only starting after required args since opt args may access others and rest args conflicts with compileRoot using ""0"" to indicate [] signature."
DESIGN	If it is a single-arg when but contains an array we know it is a real literal array FIXME This is a gross way to figure it out parser help similar to yield argument passing (expandArguments) would be better
DESIGN	TODO Only setAccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non-public interface. (aka java.util.zip.ZipConstants being implemented by many classes)
DESIGN	not intended to be called directly by users (private) OLD TODO from Ruby code This should be implemented in JavaClass.java where we can check for reserved Ruby names conflicting methods etc.
DESIGN	FIXME do not allow multiple threads to do this at once
DESIGN	TODO Bleeding runtime into parser. Arity may be should be in parser (to keep bleeding oneway)
DESIGN	"* rb_ary_push_m * FIXME Whis is this named ""push_m""?"
DESIGN	TODO This probably is not the best hack but it works until we can have different root frame setup for 1.9 easily.
DESIGN	"TODO At least ParserSupport.attrset passes argsNode as null. ImplicitNil is wrong magic for setupArgs since it will IRubyObject[] { nil }. So we need to figure out a nice fast null pattern for setupArgs. assert argsNode != null ""receiverNode is not null"""
DESIGN	HACK in order to have stdout/err act like ttys and flush always we set anything assigned to stdout/stderr to sync
DESIGN	TODO People extending GzipWriter/reader will break. Find better way here.
DESIGN	FIXME set up a call configuration for this
DESIGN	"* * Process streams get Channel.newChannel()ed into FileChannel but are not actually * seekable. So instead of just the isSeekable check doing instanceof FileChannel * we must also add this boolean to check which we set to false when it is known * that the incoming channel is from a process. * * FIXME This is gross and it is NIO's fault for not providing a nice way to * tell if a channel is ""really"" seekable."
DESIGN	again should not happen. TODO might want to throw exception instead.
DESIGN	FIXME Can get optimized for IEqlNode
DESIGN	TODO rounding mode should not be hard-coded. See mode.
DESIGN	FIXME moved this here to get what is obviously a utility method out of IRubyObject. perhaps security methods should find their own centralized home at some point.
DESIGN	FIXME If NativeException is expected to be used from Ruby code it should provide a real allocator to be used. Otherwise Class.new will fail as will marshalling. JRUBY-415
DESIGN	FIXME this should go somewhere more generic -- maybe IdUtil
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Move this code to some utils area .. or probably there is already a method for this in some jruby utils class Holy cow! Just to append two darned arrays!
DESIGN	TODO set our metaclass to target's class (i.e. scary!)
DESIGN	add 'new' with full signature so it is guaranteed to be directly accessible TODO no need for this to be a full formal JVM signature
DESIGN	context is null wipe out the SoftReference (this could be done with a reference queue)
DESIGN	TODO remove
DESIGN	TODO This is actually now returning the scope of whoever called Methodto_proc which is obviously wrong but there is no scope to provide for many methods. It fixes JRUBY-2237 but needs a better solution.
DESIGN	* * * @author headius * FIXME convert to enum ?
DESIGN	The following three methods must be defined fast since they expect to modify the current frame (i.e. they expect no frame will be allocated for them). JRUBY-1185.
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Can this return anything other than nil?
DESIGN	XXX const lookup can trigger const_missing is that enough to warrant it always being executed?
DESIGN	TODO Should frozen error have its own distinct class? If not should more share?
DESIGN	TODO Only used by interface implementation eliminate it
DESIGN	FIXME null check is removable once we figure out how to assign to unset named block args
DESIGN	For JRUBY-2759 when MET choose CET timezone to work around Joda
DESIGN	FIXME This is gross. do not do this.
DESIGN	FIXME I think we need these pushed somewhere?
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Deprecated! Going forward all instructions should come from the CFG
DESIGN	TODO should probably apply the null object pattern for a non-allowed class rather than null
DESIGN	TODO Should next and return also catch here?
DESIGN	Yow this is still ugly
DESIGN	add method with full signature so it is guaranteed to be directly accessible TODO no need for this to be a full formal JVM signature
DESIGN	* * FIXME This version is faster than the previous but both suffer from a * crucial flaw It is impossible to create an ObjectSpace with an iterator * that does not either a. hold on to objects that might otherwise be collected * or b. have no way to guarantee that a call to hasNext() will be correct or * that a subsequent call to next() will produce an object. For our purposes * for now this may be acceptable.
DESIGN	FIXME Clearing read buffer here is this appropriate?
DESIGN	TODO specifying soft refs may want to compare memory consumption behavior with weak refs (specify WEAK in place of SOFT below)
DESIGN	FIXME lose syntactical elements here (and others like this)
DESIGN	ENEBO Totally weird naming (in MRI is not allocated and is a local var name)
DESIGN	FIXME This does not actually support anything but String
DESIGN	up to ten stuff into tmp locals load in reverse order and assign FIXME there is probably a slightly smarter way but is it important?
DESIGN	XXX do something?
DESIGN	TODO Only setAccessible to account for pattern found by accessing constants included from a non-public interface. (aka java.util.zip.ZipConstants being implemented by many classes) TODO not sure we need this at all since we only expose public fields. field.setAccessible(true)
DESIGN	FIXME we want to eliminate these type casts when possible
DESIGN	TODO decompose getJavaPackageModule so we do not parse fullName
DESIGN	HACK force clinit to be created
DESIGN	FIXME If true array is common enough we should pre-allocate and stick somewhere
DESIGN	TODO This is almost RubyModuleinstance_methods on the metaClass. Perhaps refactor.
DESIGN	FIXME Added this because marshal_spec seemed to reconstitute objects without calling dataWrapStruct this resulted in object being null after unmarshalling
DESIGN	TODO ary_sort_check should be done here
DESIGN	exit monitor before making call FIXME this not being in a finally is a little worrisome
DESIGN	self = args[0] SSS FIXME Verify that this is correct
DESIGN	This is for JRUBY-2988 since after a suspend the terminal seems to need to be reinitialized. Since we cannot easily detect suspension initialize after every readline. Probably not fast but this is for interactive terminals anyway so who cares?
DESIGN	TODO do above but not below for additional newline nodes
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Receiver -- this is the class meta object basically? Operand receiver = build(defsNode.getReceiverNode() s)
DESIGN	FIXME This whole thing could probably be implemented as a module and mixed into appropriate classes especially if it uses either IOInput/OutputStream or is smart about the kind of IO-like object it is being used against.
DESIGN	FIXME bit of a kludge here (non-interface classes assigned to both class and module fields). simplifies proxy extender code will go away when JI is overhauled (and proxy extenders are deprecated).
DESIGN	FIXME what should these really be? Numeric? assert x instanceof RubyComplex && y instanceof RubyComplex
DESIGN	we are depending on the side effect of the load which loads the class but does not turn it into a script I do not like it but until we restructure the code a bit more we will need to quietly let it by here.
DESIGN	FIXME we should also support orgs that use capitalized package names (including embarrassingly the one I work for) but this should be enabled by a system property as the expected default behavior for an upper-case value should be (and is) to treat it as a class name and raise an exception if it is not found
DESIGN	index for the item this could probably be more efficient bailing out on assigning args past the end?
DESIGN	FIXME This is temporary since the variable compilers assume we want args already on stack for assignment. We just pop and continue with 1.9 args logic.
DESIGN	TODO eliminate?
DESIGN	TODO handle writing into original buffer better
DESIGN	This is a fairly specific hack for empty string but it does the job
DESIGN	XXX This constructor is a hack to implement the __END__ syntax. Converting a reader back into an InputStream does not generally work.
DESIGN	method has more than 500 lines we will need to split it and therefore need to use a heap-based scope
DESIGN	The implementations of these are all bonus (see TODO above) I was going to throw an error from these but it appears to be the wrong place to do it.
DESIGN	entry exists proxy does not match. replace. this could happen if old proxy was gc'ed TODO raise exception if stored proxy is non-null? (not gc'ed)
DESIGN	TODO better algorithm to set precision needed
DESIGN	* * SSS FIXME Used anywhere? I do not see calls to this anywhere public Operand buildDAsgnAssignment(Node node IR_Scope s) { DAsgnNode dasgnNode = (DAsgnNode) node s.getVariableCompiler().assignLocalVariable(dasgnNode.getIndex() dasgnNode.getDepth()) } *
DESIGN	TODO Make this more intelligible value
DESIGN	TODO Split this into two sub-classes so that name and constNode can be specified seperately.
DESIGN	Not sure how well this works but it works much better than just currentTimeMillis by itself.
DESIGN	FIXME This is copied code from RubyArray. Both RE Struct and Array should share one impl This is also hacky since I construct ruby objects to access ruby arrays through aref instead of something lower.
DESIGN	FIXME No I do not like it.
DESIGN	arguments compilers always create IRubyObject[] but we want to use RubyArray.concat here FIXME as a result this is NOT efficient since it creates and then later unwraps an array
DESIGN	FIXME set up a CallConfiguration for this
DESIGN	TODO reads/writes from frame TODO information on scoping TODO visibility?
DESIGN	FIXME Somehow I would feel better if this could get the appropriate var index from the ArgumentNode
DESIGN	FIXME This is almost entirely duplicated from Main.java
DESIGN	we might need to perform a DST correction
DESIGN	Create block for this iter node FIXME We should not use the current scope if it is not actually from the same hierarchy of static scopes
DESIGN	FIXME How much more obtuse can this be? Heredoc already parsed this and saved string Do not parse..just return
DESIGN	this needs to be split since conditional calling inherited does not fit standard ruby semantics
DESIGN	XXX Again screwy evaling under previous frame's scope
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Maybe this is not really a concern after all Nesting level of this scope in the lexical nesting of scopes in the current file -- this is not to be confused with semantic nesting of scopes across files. Consider this code in a file f class M1M2M3C end So C is at lexical nesting level of 1 (the file script is at 0) in the file 'f' Semantically it is at level 3 (M1 M2 M3 are at 012). This is primarily used to ensure that variable names do not clash! i.e. definition of %v_1 in a closure should not override the use of %v_1 from the parent scope! private int _lexicalNestingLevel
DESIGN	actual type does not exactly match method return type re-get converter FIXME when the only autoconversions are primitives this will not be needed
DESIGN	FIXME we should probably still be dyncalling 'write' here
DESIGN	do not bother to check if final method it will not be there (not generated cannot be!)
DESIGN	TODO Generalize this type-checking code into IRubyObject helper.
DESIGN	FIXME needs to be rethought
DESIGN	ruby constants for strings (should this be moved somewhere else?)
DESIGN	let us only generate methods for those the user may actually intend to override. That includes any defined in the current class and any ancestors that are also JavaProxyClasses (but none from any other ancestor classes). Methods defined in mixins will be considered intentionally overridden except those from Kernel Java and JavaProxyMethods as well as Enumerable. TODO may want to exclude other common mixins?
DESIGN	FIXME I do not like the null checks here
DESIGN	invoke callMethodMissing method directly TODO this could be further optimized since some DSLs hit method_missing pretty hard
DESIGN	TODO confirm expected args are IRubyObject (or similar)
DESIGN	TODO this is really ineffient and potentially a problem everytime anyone require's something. we should try to make LoadPath a special array object.
DESIGN	if we get here we found a matching method use it TODO choose narrowest method by continuing to search
DESIGN	* rb_obj_id * * Return the internal id of an object. * * FIXME Should this be renamed to match its ruby name?
DESIGN	FIXME Why was this using a FullFunctionCallbackMethod before that did callSuper?
DESIGN	* Fixme This does not have exact same semantics as RubyArray.join but they * probably could be consolidated (perhaps as join(args[] sep doChomp)).
DESIGN	lame generics issues making Segment class static and manually inserting cache reference to work around various problems generically referencing methods/vars across classes.
DESIGN	FIXME This determine module is in a strange location and should somehow be in block
DESIGN	TODO? I think this ends up propagating from normal Java exceptions sys_fail(openFile.getPath())
DESIGN	this seems unlikely to happen unless it is a totally bogus fileno so do we even need to bother trying to create one?
DESIGN	TODO turn off the negative? will return -0.0 in lax mode
DESIGN	TODO list.subList(from to).clear() is supposed to clear the sublist from the list. How can we support this operation?
DESIGN	SSS FIXME What is the difference between ClassVarAsgnNode & ClassVarDeclNode
DESIGN	see note below re 2-field kludge
DESIGN	we are not setting the provider or anything but it seems that BouncyCastle does some internal things in its provider's constructor which require it to be executed in a secure context. Ideally this hack should be removed. See JRUBY-3919 and this BC bug
DESIGN	this is a rather ugly hack but similar to MRI. See hash.cruby_setenv and similar in MRI we search all keys for a case-insensitive match and use that
DESIGN	TODO WRONG - get interfaces from class
DESIGN	TODO Make callCoerced work in block context then fix downto step and upto.
DESIGN	FIXME the code below is a copy of RubyIO.puts and we should avoid copy-paste.
DESIGN	install invokedynamic bootstrapper TODO need to abstract this setup behind another compiler interface
DESIGN	FIXME inefficient constructing a bignum just for dumping?
DESIGN	TODO Ruby does not seem to care about invalid numeric mode values I am not sure if ruby overflows here also
DESIGN	FIXME Obvious issue that not all platforms can display all attributes. Ugly hacks. Using generic posix library makes pushing inspect behavior into specific system impls rather painful.
DESIGN	rb_copy_generic_ivar from DUP_SETUP here unlikely..
DESIGN	FIXME this really ought to be in clinit but it does not matter much
DESIGN	TODO callback for value would be more efficient but unlikely to be a big cost (constants are rarely assigned)
DESIGN	using IOChannel may not be the most performant way but it is easy.
DESIGN	TODO this should entry into error handling somewhere
DESIGN	TODO make this do specific-arity calling
DESIGN	FIXME legal here? may want UnsupportedOperationException
DESIGN	FIXME This is an ugly hack to resolve JRUBY-1381 I am not proud of it
DESIGN	for visibility checking without requiring frame self TODO do not bother passing when fcall or vcall and adjust callsite appropriately

DESIGN	TODO NOT_ALLOCATABLE_ALLOCATOR is probably ok here. Confirm. JRUBY-415
DESIGN	TODO catch exception if constant is already set by other thread
DESIGN	TODO This version differs from ioctl by checking whether fcntl exists and raising notimplemented if it does not perhaps no difference for us?
DESIGN	TODO Implement tty? and isatty. We have no real capability to determine this from java but if we could set tty status then we could invoke jruby differently to allow stdin to return true on this. This would allow things like cgi.rb to work properly.
DESIGN	FIXME We should be getting this from the runtime rather than assume none? return runtime.getEncodingService().getEncoding(runtime.getDefaultExternalEncoding())
DESIGN	Objectto_a is obsolete. We match Ruby's hack until to_a goes away. Then we can remove this hack too.
DESIGN	TODO This is not an exact port of MRI's pipe behavior so revisit
DESIGN	TODO protected methods. this is going to require a rework of some of the mechanism.
DESIGN	TODO factor this chunk as in MRI/YARV GETASTER
DESIGN	FIXME what should this really be? assert x instanceof RubyComplex
DESIGN	FIXME This is not right for within ensured/rescued code
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Token can be final for a method -- implying that the token is only for this particular implementation of the method But if the mehod is modified we create a new method object which in turn gets a new token. What makes sense?? Intuitively it seems the first one but let us see Current code version token for this method -- can change during execution as methods get redefined!
DESIGN	set up a field for the CacheEntry TODO make this an array so it is not as much class metadata similar to AbstractScript stuff
DESIGN	TODO It would be nice to throw a better error for this
DESIGN	TODO newTypeError does not offer enough for ruby error string
DESIGN	SSS FIXME I added this in. Is this correct?
DESIGN	upper-case package name TODO top-level upper-case package was supported in the previous (Ruby-based) implementation so leaving as is. see note at getProxyOrPackageUnderPackage re future approach below the top-level.
DESIGN	TODO This is also defined in the MetaClass too Consolidate somewhere.
DESIGN	FIXME ConstDecl could be two seperate classes (or done differently since constNode and name never exist at the same time.
DESIGN	FIXME finalizer should be dupped here
DESIGN	TODO NOT_ALLOCATABLE_ALLOCATOR is probably ok here since we do not intend for people to monkey with this type and it cannot be marshalled. Confirm. JRUBY-415
DESIGN	"TODO number formatting here MRI uses ""%-.10g"" 1.4 API is a must?"
DESIGN	TODO need to get this back into the method signature now is too late
DESIGN	super calls from proxies must use reflected method FIXME possible to make handles do the superclass call?
DESIGN	optional args so we have IRubyObject[] TODO confirm
DESIGN	TODO better error handling
DESIGN	FIXME not very efficient
DESIGN	SSS FIXME Should this be Operand or CompoundString? Can it happen that symbols are built out of other than compound strings? Or can it happen during optimizations that this becomes a generic operand?
DESIGN	FIXME We should really not be creating the dynamic scope for the root of the AST before parsing. This makes us end up needing to readjust this dynamic scope coming out of parse (and for local static scopes it will always happen because of $~ and $_). FIXME Because we end up adjusting this after-the-fact we cannot use any of the specific-size scopes.
DESIGN	TODO wire into new exception handling mechanism
DESIGN	TODO not sure that we should skip calling join() altogether. Thread.join() has some implications for Java Memory Model etc.
DESIGN	hack to get right style for input
DESIGN	If variables were added then we may need to grow the dynamic scope to match the static one. FIXME Make this so we only need to check this for blockScope != null. We cannot currently since we create the DynamicScope for a LocalStaticScope before parse begins. Refactoring should make this fixable.
DESIGN	"SSS FIXME This method (at least in the context of multiple assignment) is a little weird. It calls regular to_ary on the object. But if it encounters a method_missing the value is inserted into an 1-element array! try ""abc = 1"" first then define Fixnum.to_ary method and try it again. Ex"
DESIGN	FIXME potentially could just use ByteList here?
DESIGN	"FIXME This is currently only here because of some problems with IOOutputStream writing to a ""bare"" runtime without a proper scope"
DESIGN	FIXME Consider fixing node_assign itself rather than single case
DESIGN	This is perhaps innefficient timewise? Optimal spacewise
DESIGN	end hack
DESIGN	ignore job was cancelled FIXME Is this ok?
DESIGN	regular division with some default precision TODO proper algorithm to set the precision
DESIGN	TODO exec should replace the current process. This could be possible with JNA.
DESIGN	"Sometimes the value can be retrieved at ""compile time"". If we succeed nothing like it! We might not .. for the following reasons 1. The constant is missing 2. The reference is a forward-reference 3. The constant's value is only known at run-time on first-access (but this is runtime is not it??) 4. Our compiler is not able to right away infer that this is a constant. SSS FIXME 1. The operand can be a literal array range or hash -- hence Operand because Array Range and Hash derive from Operand and not Constant Is there a way to fix this impedance mismatch? 2. It should be possible to handle the forward-reference case by creating a new ForwardReference operand and then inform the scope of the forward reference which the scope can fix up when the reference gets defined. At code-gen time if the reference is unresolved when a value is retrieved for the forward-ref and we get a null we can throw a ConstMissing exception! Not sure!"
DESIGN	FIXME NOT_ALLOCATABLE_ALLOCATOR is probably not right here since we might eventually want JavaArray to be marshallable. JRUBY-414
DESIGN	Workaround for JRUBY-2326 (MRI does not enter this production for some reason)
DESIGN	if body is a rescue node inspect its pieces separately to avoid it disabling all optz TODO this is gross.
DESIGN	TODO This is probably BAD
DESIGN	FIXME do we really want 'declared' methods? includes private/protected and does _not_ include superclass methods
DESIGN	FIXME should not need @__java_ovrd_methods just query locally defined methods.
DOCUMENTATION	FIXME Document difference between warn and warning (or rename one better)
DOCUMENTATION	Fixme Only F_SETFL and F_GETFL is current supported FIXME Only NONBLOCK flag is supported FIXME F_SETFL and F_SETFD are treated as the same thing here. For the case of dup(fd) we should actually have F_SETFL only affect one (it is unclear how well we do but this TODO is here to at least document that we might need to do more work here. Mostly SETFL is for mode changes which should persist across fork() boundaries. Since JVM has no fork this is not a problem for us.
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO call config with scope but no frame
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO CLONE_SETUP here
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO non-strict option
IMPLEMENTATION	TODO adjust length so it will not fall in the middle of a multi-byte character. MRI's sprintf.c uses tables in a modified version of regex.c which assume some particular encoding for a given installation/application. (See regex.cre_mbcinit in ruby-1.8.5-p12) This is only an issue if the user specifies a precision that causes the string to be truncated. The same issue would arise taking a substring of a ByteList-backed RubyString.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The reason why we need the stream is to be able to invoke available() on it. STDIN in Java is non-interruptible non-selectable and attempt to read on such stream might lead to thread being blocked without *any* way to unblock it. that is where available() comes it so at least we could check whether anything is available to be read without blocking.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	There are two different popular TZ formats legacy (AST+30000 GMT-3) and newer one (US/Pacific America/Los_Angeles). This pattern is to detect the legacy TZ format in order to convert it to the newer format understood by Java API.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The problem we trying to solve below STDIN in Java is blocked and non-interruptible so if we invoke read on it we might never be able to interrupt such thread. So we use in.available() to see if there is any input ready and only then read it. But this approach cannot tell whether the end of stream reached or not so we might end up looping right at the end of the stream. Well at least we can improve the situation by checking if some input was ever available and if so not checking for available anymore and just go to read.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"We create one extra dynamicScope on a binding so that when we 'eval ""b=1"" binding' the 'b' will get put into this new dynamic scope. The original scope does not see the new 'b' and successive evals with this binding will. I take it having the ability to have succesive binding evals be able to share same scope makes sense from a programmers perspective. One crappy outcome of this design is it requires Dynamic and Static scopes to be mutable for this one case."

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For nodes do not have their own scope so we pass null to indicate this. 'For's are implemented as blocks in evaluation but they have no scope so we just deal with this lack of scope throughout its lifespan. We should probably change the way this works to get rid of multiple null checks.

So if contents of a or b is modified the ""simplified value""s of c and d also change! This difference is captured by these two methods."

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The dataStruct is a place where custom information can be contained for core implementations that does not necessarily want to go to the trouble of creating a subclass of RubyObject.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Exclusive locks in Java require the channel to be writable otherwise an exception is thrown (terminating JRuby execution). But flock behavior of MRI is that it allows exclusive locks even on non-writable file. So we convert exclusive lock to shared lock if the channel is not writable to better match the MRI behavior.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	MRI behavior Be default 2 digits in the exponent. Use 3 digits only when necessary. See comment for writeExp method for more details.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CONSTANT TABLE METHODS - pass to delegate
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	exec needs to behave differently in-process because it is technically supposed to replace the calling process. So if we are supposed to run in-process we allow it to use the default streams and not use pumpers at all. See JRUBY-2156 and JRUBY-2154.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	this relies on the Ruby rounding enumerations == Java ones which they (currently) all are
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is either as converted as we can make it via above logic or it is not one of the types we convert so just pass it out as-is without wrapping
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	a gotcha
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Now we provide default impls of a number of signatures. For each arity we first generate a non-block version of the method which just adds NULL_BLOCK and re-calls allowing e.g. compiled code which always can potentially take a block to only generate the block-receiving signature and still avoid arg boxing. We then provide default implementations of each block-accepting method that in turn call the IRubyObject[]+Block version of call. This then finally falls back on the minimum implementation requirement for dynamic method handles.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We get canonical path to try and flatten the path out. a dir '/subdir/..' should return as '/' cnutter Do we want to flatten path out?

For some old versions of Microsoft drivers you must quote the catalog as well. But for newer versions of the driver you must not quote the catalog.

DESIGN	We are displaying a new dataset so if there was a cell editor in operation tell it to cancel. ???? How does this impact popup display?
DESIGN	KLUDGE We want some info about the columns to be available for validating the user input during cell editing operations. Ideally we would get that info inside the ResultSetDataSet class during the creation of the columnDefinition objects by using various functions in ResultSetMetaData such as isNullable(idx). Unfortunately in at least some DBMSs (e.g. Postgres HSDB) the results of those calls are not the same (and are less accurate than) the SQLMetaData.getColumns() call used in ColumnsTab to get the column info. Even more unfortunate is the fact that the set of attributes reported on by the two calls is not the same with the ResultSetMetadata listing things not provided by getColumns. Most of the data provided by the ResultSetMetaData calls is correct. However the nullable/not-nullable property is not set correctly in at least two DBMSs while it is correct for those DBMSs in the getColumns() info. Therefore we collect the collumn nullability information from getColumns() and pass that info to the ResultSet to override what it got from the ResultSetMetaData.
DESIGN	* * the utility class that reads and writes release info from/to the release.xml file TODO Spring-inject * when this class is a Spring bean
DESIGN	TODO This will not work when the column has values with quotes in them. Use PreparedStatements instead. Hmmm instead of insert statements could we not just create a sequence and generate a select statement that a) uses the sequence for the pkid b) selects distinct values That would be a more efficient approach that would also eliminate this quoting problem
DESIGN	Need to somehow call SQLResultExecuterPanel.reRunSelectedResultTab(true) Something like SQLResultExecuterPanel panel = getPanel() panel.reRunSelectedResultTab(true) However that does not apply when the user is exporting from the table contents table. There needs to be a more generic way to do this for all tables containing data that is to be exported where some of the fields contain placeholders. For now we just inform the user and let them either continue or abort and change the configuration manually re-run the query / reload the table data and re-export.
DESIGN	TODO Rename this to getTableType.
DESIGN	TODO Bizarre that I could not find a valid SQL to drop an index.

DESIGN	We set expected and checksum to -1 here since we do not have that information for release.xml file TODO Can HttpClient be used to get the byte-size of release.xml so we can perform this check?
DESIGN	Here I do not completely understand how these types are to be used in all databases and I have not yet had time to implement support in the dialects for them. So this exclude list will keep these less commonly used types from failing the test. Also since not all of these types appear in Java5 and we currently support compiling the code base with it I use the integer values for new types that were introduces in Java6 rather than the type constant name.

DESIGN	Drop FK constraints before dropping any tables. Otherwise we may drop the child table prior to dropping it is FKs which would be an error. TODO This should be done in the dialect's getTableDropSQL method for a database specific handling(or ignoring) of this problem.
DESIGN	Silently ignore what could we do anyway?
DESIGN	TODO Figure out why the selection of the root node in the object tree is undone if we do not delay. It seems like some other thread racing to set the selected node to none. When this happens the detail pane for the root node disappears when a session is first opened or when an ObjectTree frame is created. This is a really crappy and unreliable way to fix this problem but it hides the problem for now. A better understanding of the architecture of session creation is required before a proper solution can be attempted. RMM 20051217
DESIGN	TODO Temporary until we sort out a better way to do guido's fix assertEquals(SECOND_STMT_SEP qt2.getSQLStatementSeparator())
DESIGN	"TODO Maybe we should have a checkbox to allow the user to toggle default value on/off. Some dbs (like DB2) treat empty string """" as a different default value than null."
DESIGN	"check the error stream for a problem This is a bit questionable since it is possible for processes to output something on stderr but continue processing. But without this some problems are not seen (e.g. ""bad argument"" type messages from the process)."
DESIGN	OK this is a hack. Currently when precision == scale I have no way to determine if this is valid for the actual data. The problem comes when the source db's precision/scale are greater - or reported to be greater - than the precision/scale of the destination db. In this case it maximimizes both for the destination causing a definition that allows 0 digits to the left of the decimal. Trouble is without looking at the actual data there is no way to tell if this is valid - in some cases it will be ok (0.0000000789) in others it will not be ok (100.123). So for now make the scale be approx. one-half of the precision to accomodate the most digits to the left and right of the decimal and hopefully that covers the majority of cases.

DESIGN	?? Is there any way to check for invalid input? Valid input includes ?? at least any printable character but could it also include unprintable ?? characters?
DESIGN	TODO These 2 should be handled with an Iterator.
DESIGN	This is (a logically not sufficent) try to cope with the problem that there are the following contradictory rules in the JDBC API Doc Statement.getResultSet() This method should be called only once per result. Statement.getUpdateCount() This method should be called only once per result. Statement.getMoreResults() There are no more results when the following is true (!getMoreResults() && (getUpdateCount() == -1) If getMoreResults() returns false we do not know if we have more results we only know that it is not a result set. Since we called getUpdateCount() before getMoreResults() because we would like to know the update count of the first result we might not be allowed to call getUpdateCount() again. The Intersystems Cache Driver for example always returns the same updateCount on simple INSERT UPDATE DELETE statements not matter if getMoreResults() was called. So updateCount never gets -1 and this will loop forever. When I discussed the issue with the Intersystems people they just told me not to call getUpdateCount() twice. That simple. My hope is that this will cure problems with DBs that just do not care for multiple result sets.
DESIGN	Required otherwise it gets too wide.
DESIGN	The call here is the result of a desperate fight to find a place where the components in the split had not height = 0. If someone knows a better way please tell me I will apreciate any advice. gerdwagner@users.sourceforge.net

DESIGN	TODO should I be adding quotes if user wants identifiers quoted??
DESIGN	The following ugly conversion from text to Byte is necessary because the Byte class is inconsistant. When asked to output as Hex it does so as an UNSIGNED byte but when asked to read back the same thing using the Hex radix it insists that the input must be SIGNED. To get around this we up-size the conversion to Integer then truncate that to a byte and finally convert the byte to a Byte. Yech.
DESIGN	this should just bring back one table i hope.

DESIGN	"do not use tinyint for now even though Mckoi ""supports"" it. it is notion of tinyint is 7-bit (not 8-bit) so it is not compatible with other DBs and leads to overflow (resulting in negative values which are a corruption of the actual value inserted/updated). This is not a great work-around. I filed a bug report on the mailing list hopefully it will get fixed soon."
DESIGN	TODO Need to define a better approach to getting dialects. That is we do not really want to ever prompt the user in this case. it is always Oracle. Yet we may have a new OracleDialect at some point.

It may not be necessary since the following doens't hurt if already a MyISAM engine ALTER TABLE my_table ENGINE = MYISAM Still this is not the kind of thing we would want to do automatically since MyISAM engine is non-transactional. We will probably need to tell the user - somehow - that they need this otherwise the create index statement will fail. Maybe a comment in the script and if they happen to read it they could uncomment the conversion of the engine? Maybe a custom dialog?

DESIGN	JASON Make menu smarter. When second window for the same session is added create a hierarchical menu for all windows for the session.
DESIGN	* * TODO Clean this mess up!!!! Load plugins. Load all plugin jars into class loader.
DESIGN	For some reason when the Oracle plugin adds details tabs for triggers the _tabPnl's first tab ends up being the trigger details tab and not the generic database object info tab. This causes the _tabs length to be 1 tab greater than the tabs that are actually in the _tabPnl. This throws off the selection such that the tab selected in the tab panel does not get rendered until the tab to the right of the selected tab is selected. This is a work-around for this problem until I can determine why the DatabaseObjectInfoTab never makes it into the _tabPnl in the first place.
DESIGN	The following is a work-around for the problem on Mac OS X where the Apple LAF delegates to the Swing Popup factory but then tries to set a 90% alpha on the underlying Cocoa window which will always be null if you are using JGoodies L&F see This has no effect on Linux/Windows
DESIGN	No appropriate DataType for this column so do the best we can with what we know. THIS MAY NOT BE THE BEST BEHAVIOR HERE!!!!!!!
DESIGN	colDefs not in same order as DB so search for matching colDef entry Note linear search here will NORMALLY be not too bad because most tables do not have huge numbers of columns.
DESIGN	"TODO What about these Viewport.font ColorChooser.font InternalFrame.font OptionPane.font ""Panel.font"" ScrollPane.font DesktopIcon.font"
DESIGN	"do not use ""real"" type. Axion sets the column size to 12 by default yet it can handle more precision. So data being copied from the real column can potentially be larger than what the column claims to support. This will be a problem for other databases that pay attention to the column size. TODO Perhaps re-introduce the REAL type but use the new getPrecisionDigits to max out the precision."
DESIGN	The following only works if SwingUtilities.getRoot(table) returns and instanceof BaseMDIParentFrame. If SwingTUilities.getRoot(table) returns and instance of Dialog or Frame then other code must be used.
DESIGN	This info is merely a placeholder in the tree that we can use to get index name and parent name more easily. We probably should create a IndexColumnInfo that has this extra info in it.
DESIGN	TODO should the constraint name simply be the column name or something more like a constraint name?
DESIGN	Some tables have pseudo column primary keys and others do not. JDBC on some DBMSs does not handle pseudo columns 'correctly'. Also getTables returns 'views' as well as tables so the thing we are looking at might not be a table. (JDBC does not give a simple way to determine what we are looking at since the type of object is described in a DBMS-specific encoding.) For these reasons rather than testing for all these conditions we just try using the pseudo column info to get the table data and if that fails we try to get the table data without using the pseudo column. TODO Should we change the mode from editable to non-editable?
DESIGN	TODO maybe instead of throwing an exception we could ask the user if they would like us to adjust their preference for them.
DESIGN	HACK some dbs (like Frontbase) do not support boolean types. I have tried tinyint bit and boolean as the column type and setBoolean fails for all three. it is a mystery at this point what column the getBoolean/setBoolean methods actually work on iin FrontBase.

DESIGN	?? Split these 4 functions off into a subclass of BaseFavouriteAction
DESIGN	Arrays of Strings are a special case. In XMLBeanWriter method ProcessProperty an array of Strings is turned into a list of StringWrapper objects in the XML (presumably so that when reading them back we have a class that we can call setters on). Thus when reading back an array of Strings we actually read an array of StringWrappers which gives a type mis-match in the following arrayCopy. Therefore we need to convert the data that is currently in the StringWrapper objects into actual Strings.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check to see if new data is same as old data in which case we do not update the underlying data. This is NOT an optimization (though it does speed things up). We need to do this to avoid an error when we check for rows being changed in the DB. If the new value and old value are the same when we look to see if any rows already exist with the new value it will find the existing row and claim that the update will make one row identical to the changed row (i.e. that there will be two identical rows in the DB) which is not true. So we avoid the problem by not updating the DB if the data has not been changed. This can happen if user changes the cell contents then changes them back before exiting the cell.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	PostgreSQL follows the standard for SQL BIT. it is a string of BITs. So bit(10) is a string of 10 bits. JDBC treats SQL BIT as if it were only a single BIT. It specifies that BIT is equivalent to BOOLEAN. It claims that the PreparedStatement set method that should be used with BIT is setBoolean and getBoolean. This is not compliant with the standard. So SQL BIT type support is broken in Java there is nothing we can do about that. Best thing to do for now is try to convert the BIT type to a boolean like the JDBC spec says and hope for the best. Hope that the source database is not using the BIT column as a sequence of multiple BITs.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	* If the object representing the actual data (i.e. this object) * can be edited by the user then the fw objects need to have * a reference to it. Updateable objects must implement an * interface derived from IDataSetUpdateableComponent in the * net.sourceforge.squirrel_sql.fw.datasetviewer package. * If the component does not implement that interface * then we just keep going but if it does implement it * then we need to tell the DataSetScrollingPanel that the * object that fw needs to call is this one.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"There are some fields that cannot be used in a WHERE clause either because there cannot be an exact match (e.g. REAL FLOAT) or because we may not have the actual data in hand (BLOB/CLOB) or because the data cannot be expressed in a string form (e.g. BINARY). An update to one of those fields will look like we are replacing one row with an identical row (because we can only ""see"" the fields that we know how to do where is on). Therefore when we are updating them there should be exactly one row that matches all of our other fields and when we are not updating one of these special types of fields there should be no rows that exactly match our criteria (we hope). We determine whether this field is one that cannot be used in the WHERE clause by checking the value returned for that field to use in the WHERE clause. Any field that can be used there will return something of the form "" = "" and a field that cannot be used will return a null or zero-length string."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add more space to the top of the component
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If the user has cancelled the query do not bother logging an error message. It is likely that the cancel request interfered with the attempt to fetch results from the ResultSet which is to be expected when the Statement is closed. So let us not bug the user with obvious error messages that we can do nothing about.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	JASON Removed as part of patch void removeSessionListener(ISessionListener lis)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	There is no need to close result sets if we call _stmt.getMoreResults() because it implicitly closes any current ResultSet. ON DB2 version 7.1 it is even harmful to close a ResultSet explicitly. _stmt.getMoreResults() will never return true anymore if you do.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	DO NOT CHANGE THE VALUES OF THIS CONSTANTS. These constants where introduced to make the parser code more readable. Care was taken. Still it can not be guaranteed that changing a value will not be harmful.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	I have seen the reference to the outer class being null when this method is called. I have seen it only with the runtime jars and on Linux. I could not reproduce in my IDE.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Note A CaseInsensitiveString can be a mutable string. In fact it is a mutable string here because this is usually called from within Syntax coloring which uses a mutable string.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CopyOnWriteArrayList is unfortunately not sort-able as a List. So this will throw an UnsupportedOperationException Collections.sort(_iTableInfos new TableInfoSimpleNameComparator()) The following is the best approach according to concurrency master Doug Lea in this post Here we copy the existing internal array into a new array that is large enough to hold the original and new elements. Then sort it. And finally create a new CopyOnWriteArrayList with the sorted array.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use all of the columns
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	* When user leaves a cell after editing it the contents of * that cell need to be converted from a string into an * object of the appropriate type before updating the table. * However when the call comes from the Popup window the data * has already been converted and validated. * We assume that a String being passed in here is a value from * a text field that needs to be converted to an object and * a non-string object has already been validated and converted.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	save various info about the column for use in user input validation when editing table contents. Note that the columnDisplaySize is included two times where the first entry may be adjusted for actual display while the second entry is the size expected by the DB. The isNullable() method returns three values that we convert into two by saying that if it is not known whether or not a column allows nulls we will allow the user to enter nulls and any problems will be caught when they try to save the data to the DB
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	/ Implement the IDataSetTableControls interface functions needed to support table operations These functions are called from within MyJTable and MyTable to tell those classes how to operate. The code in these functions will be different depending on whether the table is read-only or editable. The definitions below are for read-only operation. The editable table panel overrides these functions with the versions that tell the tables how to set up for editing operations. /
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	handle mouse events for double-click creation of popup dialog. This happens only in the JTextField not the JTextArea so we can make this an inner class within this method rather than a separate inner class as is done with the KeyTextHandler class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	if use is not looking for ASCII chars or if this one is one that is not printable then convert it into numeric form
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CLOBs are different from normal data types in that what is actually read from the DB is a descriptor pointing to the data rather than the data itself. During the initial load of the table the values read from the descriptor may have been limited but the descriptor itself has been completely read Therefore we do not need to re-read the datum from the Database because we know that we have the entire descriptor. If the contents of the CLOB have been limited during the initial table load that will be discovered when we check if the cell is editable and the full data will be read at that time using this descriptor.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	i18n[rowInputDataFrame.conversionErr=Conversion Error]

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	We want to detect two empty text values in a row before we decide to restore the original value. Since 'text' contains the new value we want to allow the first empty 'text' so that the user can clear the field and on the second one we will set it to the original value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tables that are netiher children nor parents - utility tables
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"* Now the Popup-related methods. These are not quite symmetric with the * in-cell calls because the conversion of the object into the text to * display in the popup is handled internally to the DataType object inside * getJTextArea() so we do not need a ""renderObjectInPopup"" function * visible to the rest of the world."

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Since we can use a correlated sub-query to update all rows in one statement we do not care about the set values unless fromTables is null in which case we go with a normal update. Using the set values would require an update statement for each row in the merged table for each column that was merged in which is incredibly inefficient. However the API is intended to support database dialects that cannot handle correlated sub-queries.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do not change the case of the identifier if database allows mixed case.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	From PostgreSQL 8.2 documentation CREATE [ UNIQUE ] INDEX [ CONCURRENTLY ] name ON table [ USING method ] ( { column | ( expression ) } [ opclass ] [ ] ) [ WITH ( storage_parameter = value [ ] ) ] [ TABLESPACE tablespace ] [ WHERE predicate ]
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The index is needed in case this method is called with schema = null catalog = null and two tables with the same name in different schemas/catalogs. Without the index the same ordinal position could only occur once.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Tables might have triggers that depend on sequences so drop tables next.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	db2pkCol is used to create a PK when using DB2. DB2 does not allow you to add a PK to a table after it has been constructed unless the column(s) that comprise the PK were originally there when created *and* created not null.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Oracle declares the column size to be 4000 regardless of the maximum length of the CLOB field. So if the Oracle BLOB/CLOB column contains values that exceed 4000 chars and we use colInfo.getColumnSize() we might create a destination column that is too small for the data that will be copied from Oracle. We specify a default value of 4000 in case the table has no records or if the BLOB/CLOB column contains only null values.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	* * Reads the value from the specified ResultSet at column index index and based on the type calls the * appropriate setXXX method on ps with the value obtained. * * @param ps * @param sourceColType * @param destColType * @param index * @param rs * @return a string representation of the value that was bound. * @throws SQLException
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is always thrown as said in Embedded Derby API. So it is not error it is info
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"value is a simple string representation of the data but NOT the same one used in the Text and in-cell operations. The in-cell version may replace newline chars with ""\n"" while this version does not. In other respects it is the same as the in-cell version because both use the _renderer object to do the rendering."
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are limiting some things. if the string we have is less than the limit then we are ok and do not need to re-read (because we already have the whole thing).

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	tell the rest of the world that the table has changed. The 'fire' method used here is very course - it says that the whole table has been changed when really only one row has been added. However finer-grained methods did not seem to because the right effect so I am using this one untill someone reports a problem with it. Also if either of these notifications (the actual model and the sortable model) are eliminated it either throws an exception or does not update the GUI. Go figure. Finally the 'fire' on the _acutalModel is triggered from this method rather than from inside the MyJTable code because the add() method used to add a row is also used when loading the table with lots of rows and in that case we do not want to generate events until all of the rows have been added so the 'fire' cannot happen there.
