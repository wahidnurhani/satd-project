DEFECT	FIXME formatters are not thread-safe
DEFECT	"XXX (Jon Skeet) The comment ""if it has not been done already"" may not be strictly true. wrapper.maybeConfigure() will not configure the same attributes/text more than once but it may well add the children again unless I have missed something."
DEFECT	I hate to admit it but we do not know what happened here. Throw the Exception.
DEFECT	Just a note StarTeam has a status for NEW which implies that there is an item on your local machine that is not in the repository. These are the items that show up as NOT IN VIEW in the Starteam GUI. One would think that we would want to perhaps checkin the NEW items (not in all cases! - Steve Cohen 15 Dec 2001) Unfortunately the sdk does not really work and we cannot actually see anything with a status of NEW. That is why we can just check out everything here without worrying about losing anything.
DEFECT	the generated classes must not be added in the generic JAR! is that buggy on old JOnAS (2.4) ??
DEFECT	"This is turned off temporarily. There appears to be a bug in SelectorUtils.matchPattern() where it is recursive on Windows even if no ** is in pattern. assertEquals(""FFFTFFFFFFFF"" results) Unix vs assertEquals(""FFFTFFFFTFFF"" results) Windows"
DEFECT	pattern now holds ** while string is not exhausted this will generate false positives but we can live with that.
DEFECT	"FIXME Is ""No Namespace is Empty Namespace"" really OK?"
DEFECT	FIXME this is actually not very cpu cycles friendly as we are converting from dos to java while the underlying Sun implementation will convert from java to dos time for internal storage
DEFECT	check first that it is not already loaded otherwise consecutive runs seems to end into an OutOfMemoryError or it fails when there is a native library to load several times. this is far from being perfect but should work in most cases.
DEFECT	TODO A warning line that shows code which contains a variable error will because some trouble. The parser should definitely be much better.
DEFECT	todo is this comment still relevant ?? FIXME need to use a SAXSource as the source for the transform so we can plug in our own entity resolver
DESIGN	* XXX I really do not like this - the XML processor is still * too 'involved' in the processing. A better solution (I am going to) * would be to create UE for Project and Target too and * then process the tree and have Project/Target deal with * its attributes ( similar with Description ). * * If we eventually switch to ( or add support for ) DOM * things will work smoothly - UE can be avoided almost completely * ( it could still be created on demand for backward compatibility )
DESIGN	JUnit 4 wraps solo tests this way. We can extract the original test name with a little hack.
DESIGN	XXX ignore attributes in a different NS ( maybe store them ? )
DESIGN	borrowed from TokenFilterTest
DESIGN	XXX Move to Project ( so it is shared by all helpers )
DESIGN	What is the property supposed to be?
DESIGN	PR Hack for ant-type value an ant-type is a component name which can be namespaced need to extract the name and convert from qualified name to uri/name
DESIGN	there is a convenient xsltc class version but data are private so use package information
DESIGN	stolen from org.apache.xerces.impl.XMLEntityManagergetUserDir() of the Xerces-J team which ASCII characters need to be escaped
DESIGN	bingo append it. (this should normally not be done here)
DESIGN	This is faintly ridiculous
DESIGN	cannot remove underscores due to protected visibility >(
DESIGN	TODO not read yet in a public setter
DESIGN	PR I do not know what to do if the object class has multiple defines but this is for logging only
DESIGN	not sure what could be the need of this
DESIGN	XXX (Jon Skeet) Any reason for writing a message and then using a bare RuntimeException rather than just using a BuildException here? Is it in case the message could end up being written to no loggers (as the loggers could have failed to be created due to this failure)?
DESIGN	Experimental/Testing will be removed
DESIGN	XXX should instead make a new ProtectionDomain with a CodeSource corresponding to container.toURI().toURL() and the same PermissionCollection as Project.class.protectionDomain had
DESIGN	this is really irritating we need a way to set stuff
DESIGN	XXX All this to convert source to destination directory according to weblogic standards Can be written better this is too hacky!
DESIGN	silly hack to avoid stack overflow
DESIGN	-------------------- Access to property tables -------------------- This is used to support ant call and similar tasks. It should be deprecated it is possible to use a better (more efficient) mechanism to preserve the context.
DESIGN	Temporary - until we figure a better API
DESIGN	There is a better way to save the context. This should not delegate to next it is for backward compatibility only.
DESIGN	quick fix for Ant.java use of property before initializing the project
DESIGN	XXX we should use JCVS ( instead of command line execution so that we do not rely on having native CVS stuff around (SM)
DESIGN	* two reasons are mentioned in the API docs for File.list * (1) dir is not a directory. This is impossible as * we would not get here in this case. * (2) an IO error occurred (why does not it throw an exception * then???)
DESIGN	"* * Jakarta Commons Logging listener. * Note do not use the SimpleLog as your logger implementation as it * causes an infinite loop since it writes to System.err which Ant traps * and reroutes to the logger/listener layer. * * The following names are used for the log * org.apache.tools.ant.Project.PROJECT_NAME - for project events * org.apache.tools.ant.Target.TARGET_NAME - for target events * TASK_CLASS_NAME.TARGET_NAME - for events in individual targets. * * In all target and project names we replace ""."" and "" "" with ""-"". * * TODO we should use the advanced context logging features (and expose them * in c-l first -) * TODO this is _very_ inefficient. Switching the out and tracking the logs * can be optimized a lot - but may require few more changes to the core. * * @since Ant 1.5"
DESIGN	* @TODO using taskName here is brittle as a user could override it. * this should probably be modified to use the classname instead.
DESIGN	these are pathological cases but retained in case somebody subclassed us.
DESIGN	* This is a rather hairy case. * * One of our subclasses knows that we need to update the * archive but at the same time there are no resources * known to us that would need to be added. Only the * subclass seems to know what is going on. * * This happens if detects that the manifest has changed * for example. The manifest is not part of any resources * because of our support for inline s. * * If we invoke createEmptyZip like Ant 1.5.2 did * we will loose all stuff that has been in the original * archive (bugzilla report 17780).
DESIGN	This is deprecated - use classespath in the future
DESIGN	XXX this array stuff is a remnant of prev trials.. got to remove.
DESIGN	* * Set the number of milliseconds leeway to give before deciding a * target is out of date. * TODO This is not yet used. * @param granularity the granularity used to decide if a target is out of * date.
DESIGN	This may change if we add advanced parsing capabilities.
DESIGN	We assume that every output jikes does stands for an error/warning XXX Is this correct?
DESIGN	The line below is a hack the system id must an URI but it is not cleat to get the URI of an resource so just set the name of the resource as a system id
DESIGN	XXX what is the following doing? should it run if !javadoc4 && executable != null?
DESIGN	MAC OS 9 and previous TODO I have no idea how to get it someone must fix it
DESIGN	TODO nothing appears to read this but is set using a public setter.
DESIGN	XXX - we are committing CombiningChar and Extender here
DESIGN	* XXX - failed to load the class properly. * * should we print a warning here?
DESIGN	XXX could perhaps also call thread.stop() not sure if anyone cares
DESIGN	* * XXX * Perhaps we should not use properties for these * three options (emacs mode warnings and pedantic) * but include it in the javac directive?
DESIGN	XXX maybe use reflection to addPathElement (other patterns ?)
DESIGN	TODO there is a problem with the constructor for the RBC. you have to provide the rules in the constructors - no setters available.
DESIGN	probably not the best choice but it solves the problem of relative paths in CLASSPATH
DESIGN	Fix for invalid characters. If you think of more add to the list.
DESIGN	* fallback in case we have trouble loading the class or * do not know how to handle it (there is no easy way to * know what IDL mode would generate. * * This is supposed to make Ant always recompile the * class as a file of that name should not exist.
DESIGN	Check it out also ugly.
DESIGN	I cannot get my head around this is encoding treatment needed here?
DESIGN	quick & dirty to make nested mapped p-sets work
DESIGN	XXX is this code still necessary? is there any 1.2+ port? Pull in *.zip from packages directory
DESIGN	only the developer knows what (s)he is doing
DESIGN	XXX Unfortunately JDK1.2 adds entrySet() keySet() values() - implementing this requires a small hack we can add it later.
DESIGN	first developer could use a little help
DESIGN	XXX - should throw an exception instead?
DESIGN	XXX should we silently catch possible exceptions and try to load a different implementation?
DESIGN	"since Java 1.4 return normalizedPath.split(""/"") workaround for Java 1.2-1.3"
DESIGN	HAMMER end inline mainGTU
DESIGN	* * This array really should not be here. * Again for historical purposes it is. * * FIXME This array should be in a private or package private * location since it could be modified by malicious code.
DESIGN	Should move to a separate public class - and have API to add listeners etc.
DESIGN	""""" should become a single empty argument same for '' PR 5906"
DESIGN	not very nice but will do the job
DESIGN	provide public visibility
DESIGN	not used but public so theoretically must remain for BC?
DESIGN	super.validateAttributes() do not want to call this method
DESIGN	XXX what is this for?
DESIGN	We keep this so we have something to delete in later tests -)
DESIGN	************* copied from ConcatTest *************
DESIGN	not sure whether this is clean but this method is declared not to throw exceptions.
DESIGN	We just set the prefix for this fileset and pass it up. Do we need to do this? LH
DESIGN	why do we do nothing?
DESIGN	This is the new better way - use classespath instead of sourcespath. The code is currently the same - you need class files in a directory to use this or jar files.
DESIGN	XXX - why not simply new File(dir filename)?
DESIGN	This is ugly checking for the root folder.
DESIGN	TODO Parameterise ?? Call compiler as class do not want to fork again Use classic compiler -- can be parameterised?
DESIGN	XXX All this to get package according to weblogic standards Can be written better this is too hacky! Careful.. similar code in scanDir but slightly different!!
DESIGN	stolen from writeManifest
DESIGN	If the jarfile already exists then whack it and recreate it. * Should probably think of a more elegant way to handle this * so that in case of errors we do not leave people worse off * than when we started =)
DESIGN	XXX is the following really necessary? it is in the same thread group
DESIGN	we have to find a cleaner way to put this output
DESIGN	This is the old way and is deprecated - classespath is the right way to do this and is above
DESIGN	For Script example that modifies id'ed tasks in other targets to work. *very* Ugly The reference is replaced by RuntimeConfigurable
DESIGN	do not call super.close() because that reader is used on other places
DESIGN	report error if something weird happens this is diagnostic.
DESIGN	sorry - otherwise we will get a ClassCastException because the MockCache is loaded by two different classloader
DESIGN	***HACK*** We ask the VM to create an instance by voluntarily providing illegal arguments to force the VM to run the class' static initializer while at the same time not running a valid constructor.
DESIGN	Singleton for now it may change ( per/classloader )
DESIGN	XXX - should not this always return false in isolated mode?
IMPLEMENTATION	TO DO delete the file if it is not a valid file.
IMPLEMENTATION	* * This method checks the timestamp on each file listed in the * ejbFiles and compares them to the timestamp on the jarFile * .

TEST	@todo this is duplicating TestResult information. Only the time is not part of the result. So we would better derive a new class from TestResult and deal with it. (SB)

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	-------------------- Optional methods -------------------- You can override those methods if you want to optimize or do advanced things (like support a special syntax). The methods do not chain - you should use them when embedding ant (by replacing the main helper)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	This class depends on each class in the dependency list. For each one of those add this class into their affected classes list
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The captureToSummary test writes to stdout and stderr good for verifying that the TestListener support does not break anything.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now determine which jars each class depends upon
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Usually the initialized is set to true. But here it must not. Because the prepend and append readers have to be instantiated on runtime newFilter.setInitialized(true)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	return here.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"Also check for properly formed URIs. Ant formerly recommended using nonsense URIs such as ""file./foo.xml"" in XML includes.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the simple action is to send the command line in as is
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the Exec OS check is different from Os.isOs() which probes for a specific OS. Instead it searches the os field for the current os.name

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Load the property files specified by -propertyfile
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	hand down
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	just log this
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	for historical and performance reasons we have to do things in a rather complex way. (1) Move is optimized to move directories if a fileset has been included completely therefore FileSets need a special treatment. This is also required to support the failOnError semantice (skip filesets with broken basedir but handle the remaining collections). (2) We carry around a few protected methods that work on basedirs and arrays of names. To optimize stuff all resources with the same basedir get collected in separate lists and then each list is handled in one go.

For uncompressed (stored) files those calls do work. However using ZipFile.getEntries() works for both compressed and uncompressed files.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	For NetWare use the boolean=true mode so we can use delimiter information to make a better decision later.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we are on NetWare tokenizing is handled a little differently due to the fact that NetWare has multiple-character volume names.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add ant properties
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	NB this makes use of ProjectsetProperty rather than ProjectsetNewProperty due to backwards compatiblity reasons
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we have been successful on an update delete the temporary file
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	should not be possible
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Ignore - we will use the defaults.

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The local file name is simply the local target path (tgt) which has been passed recursively down from the top of the tree with the item's name appended.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	======================================================================== * * Methods
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add -revision xxxxx to the commandline
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the OS VM launcher so we get environment variables

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	type may be null because it was not set
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Just use the same directory as the file itself. This directory will exist
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	JarIndex is sorting the directories by ascending order. it has no value but cosmetic since it will be read into a hashtable by the classloader but we will do so anyway.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Insert as a string by default
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Static
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Protected first so if any GUI tool offers a default based on enum 0 it will be right.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CheckStyleVisibilityModifier OFF - bc the source file the destination file the destination directory
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	add dest dir to classpath so that previously compiled and untouched classes are on classpath
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	configure the transformer

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	convert backslashes to slashes otherwise jjtree will put this as comments and this seems to confuse javacc
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	although this code appears to duplicate that of ClasspathUtils.newInstance we cannot use that because this formatter may run in a forked process without that class.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	build the command line from what we got the format is ss History elements [-H] [-L] [-N] [-O] [-V] [-Y] [-] [-?] as specified in the SS.EXE help
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	there are places (in this file and perhaps elsewhere where it is assumed that null is an acceptable parameter.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Just call the getExecuteStreamHandler() and let it handle the semantics of instantiation or retrieval.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	conversion to URL via FileUtils like in XMLResultAggregator not as suggested in the bug report
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If this TransformOperation has DrawOperation children then Rotate the first child and return.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	converted from sun internal classes to new Base64Converter utility class extracted from Get task
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CRC compressed length uncompressed length
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	No further methods necessary. This is just an amalgamation of two other interfaces.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	copying of dirs is trivial and can be done for non-file resources as well as for real files.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"----- The ""Singleton"" -----"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	simplest case - setAttribute expects String
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Use the logger config
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If only default is specified and the property did not exist in the property file the property is set to default.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If we had child elements we need to indent before we close the element otherwise we are on the same line and do not need to indent
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The key is in the dictionary but cannot be retrieved This is usually due references that refer to tasks that have not been taskdefed in the current run. Ignore
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If value and default are both specified and the property previously existed in the property file the property is set to value.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	write magic done by caller who created this stream this.out.write('B') this.out.write('Z')

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	target file exptected string
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	mandatory constructor
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	resetting the stylesheet - reset transformer
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	do we need to reset templates as well
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Driver does not understand the URL
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	it is a task - append the target
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set parameters on each transformation maybe something has changed (e.g. value of file name parameter)
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	reuse the array created by the mapper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	shield it from being closed by a filtering StreamPumper
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	finally let us execute the compiler!!
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	does not make sense for c-l. Use the logger config
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that a suite generates no errors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Could not get the required information
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Are any other references held ? Can we 'close' the loader so it removes the locks on jars ? a new one will be created.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Finally assign the property with the manifest classpath
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Create a ZipFileSet for this file and pass it up.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	now we need to populate the compiler adapter
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	refresh attribute in case of multivalued attributes.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	execute the get
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	set the timestamp to the file date.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If no webxml file is specified it is an error.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that having no suite generates no errors
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	use wrappers for primitive classes e.g. int and Integer are treated identically
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	"One cannot RMIC an interface for ""classic"" RMI (JRMP)"
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Manifest's ClassPath attribute always uses forward slashes '/' and is space-separated. Ant will properly format it on 72 columns with proper line continuation
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we do not use the sun impl for portability and always use our own implementation for consistent testing
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	otherwise perform a timestamp comparison - at least
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	* Move the generated source file to the base directory. If * base directory and sourcebase are the same the generated * sources are already in place.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	REVISIT at this point even non HTTP connections may support the if-modified-since behaviour -we just check the date of the content and skip the write if it is not newer. Some protocols (FTP) do not include dates of course.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	no source file generated nothing to move
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	The property is the name of a file. We are testing a location attribute so we need to resolve the given file name in the provided folder.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	the method called to add/create the nested element
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	check that an invalid suite generates an error.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	Check if a create of this property is already present add takes preference over create for CB purposes
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	I do not think we can use File - different rules for relative paths.
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	** full-pathname specified == path in list ** simple name specified == path in list
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	end of try-catch
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	CheckStyleVisibilityModifier OFF - bc
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	If a helper cannot be found or if the helper is for another classloader create a new IH
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	we only get here if an exception has been thrown
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	whether or not this ProcessDestroyer has been registered as a shutdown hook
WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	not the requested type
