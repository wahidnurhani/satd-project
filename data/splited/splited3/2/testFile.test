DEFECT	do not try restoring the url todo wy not?
DEFECT	todo why do we clone the return value? this is the only reference to it (right?) so we should not need a separate copy.
DEFECT	* fix bug in jvms that return true/false rather than true/false * from the type editor getastext() method
DEFECT	should this also fail the sample? can happen for incorrect xpath expression
DEFECT	todo - why does null property have a value?
DEFECT	int contentlength = visible todo size ouststream according to actual content length
DEFECT	this would be sensible but does not work public int hashcode() { return propmap.hashcode() }
DEFECT	fixme due to startengine being commented engine will always be null private standardjmeterengine engine
DEFECT	note these lines center the about dialog in the current window. some older swing versions have a bug in getlocationonscreen() and they may not make this behave properly.
DEFECT	todo - how can this be null?
DEFECT	todo display warning dialog as this can take some time
DEFECT	todo may not work on all oses?
DEFECT	* todo error counting needs to be sorted out. * * at present the statistical sampler tracks errors separately * it would make sense to move the error count here but this would * mean lots of changes. * it is also tricky maintaining the count - it cannot just be incremented/decremented * when the success flag is set as this may be done multiple times. * the work-round for now is to do the work in the statisticalsampleresult * which overrides this method. * note that some jms samplers also create samples with > 1 sample count * also the transaction controller probably needs to be changed to do * proper sample and error accounting. * the purpose of this work-round is to allow at least minimal support for * errors in remote statistical batch mode. *
DEFECT	todo does not putting this here mark the tree as saved even though a failure may occur later?
DEFECT	todo - fix so that this is only called once per test instead of at every clone perhaps save previous filename and only load if it has changed?
DEFECT	bug in above method
DEFECT	todo should we call test listeners? that might hang too $non-nls-1$ default is true
DEFECT	fixme factor with just append all the parameter values and use that as the post body
DEFECT	* * the sslmanager handles the keystore information for jmeter. basically it * handles all the logic for loading and initializing all the jsse parameters * and selecting the alias to authenticate against if it is available. * sslmanager will try to automatically select the client certificate for you * but if it cannot make a decision it will pop open a dialog asking you for * more information. * * todo does not actually prompt *
DEFECT	* urgent todo - sort out equals and hashcode() - at present equal * instances can/will have different hashcodes - problem is when a proper * hashcode is used tests stop working e.g. listener data disappears when * switching views this presumably means that instances currently * regarded as equal are not really equal. * * @see java.lang.objecthashcode()
DEFECT	"* this means that a new page will be shown before rendering is complete * however the correct location will be displayed. * attempts to use a ""page"" propertychangelistener to detect when the page * has been loaded failed to work any better."

DESIGN	todo should this be indeterminate? todo should this be indeterminate? $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	todo should we allow null for non-primitive types?
DESIGN	todo - not sure this is the best method

DESIGN	todo - should we call start() and stop()?
DESIGN	todo is this a sensible number? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	todo work out how to search the xml pane

DESIGN	todo replace with proper exception return with an error
DESIGN	todo validate contenttype for reasonable types?
DESIGN	* mask values for test_type todo remove either match or contains - they * are mutually exckusive
DESIGN	allow jmeter to render frames (and relative images) must be done after setcontenttype [why?]
DESIGN	todo - is this used? (apart from test code)
DESIGN	todo should this be cleardata()?

DESIGN	todo should this be jtlsaver? only seems to be called by monitorhealthvisualzer
DESIGN	todo make the running indicator its own class instead of a jbutton
DESIGN	if child of transactioncontroller is a throughputcontroller and tpc does not sample its children then we will have this todo should this be at warn level ?
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ so it agrees with above todo perhaps should share code with __time() function for this $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-2$ $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-2$
DESIGN	hack to allow automated tests to find when test has ended transient boolean testended = false
DESIGN	todo could these be done earlier (or just once?)
DESIGN	hack to resolve modulecontrollers in non gui mode
DESIGN	add a system property so samplers can check to see if jmeter is running in nongui mode $non-nls-1$ todo - why does it create a new instance?
DESIGN	should we run a beanshell script on startup? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	* a little hack - add each listener to the start of the list - this * ensures that the thread running the show is the first listener and * can modify certain values before other listeners are called.
DESIGN	todo move this to components -- the only reason why it is in core is because it is used as a guinea pig by a couple of tests.
DESIGN	todo this bit of code needs to be tidied up unfortunately modulecontroller is in components not core bug 47165
DESIGN	todo this class looks a lot like argumentspanel. what exactly is the difference? could they be combined? note it seems that this class is not actually used
DESIGN	* ensure that the sample variables are correctly initialised for each run. * todo is this the best way to do this? should it be done elsewhere ?
DESIGN	* add fix for deadlocks see * * see
DESIGN	hack to allow external control
DESIGN	todo should this also clear isdynamic rawparameters permanentresults?
DESIGN	todo should level be more than debug ?
DESIGN	this is effectively the same as saver.toxml(object writer) except we get to provide the dataholder do not know why there is no method for this in the xstream class
DESIGN	todo fix up for nimbus laf
DESIGN	* * fixme why is searchtf not getting focus correctly after having been setvisible(false) once
DESIGN	hack to get full modifier value
DESIGN	todo this method does not appear to be used.
DESIGN	todo - why use space?
DESIGN	* todo consider removing this method and providing method wrappers instead. * this would allow the gui package to do any additional clearups if required * as has been done with cleartestplan()
DESIGN	maybe do nothing at all?
DESIGN	* notused private void initbuttonmap() { }
DESIGN	todo i believe the following code (to the end of the method) is obsolete since namepanel no longer seems to be the gui for any component
DESIGN	avoid error in ant task tests (good way?)
DESIGN	does not appear to be used called by mainframeseteditaddmenu() but that is not called
DESIGN	* * aggregates sample results for use by the statistical remote batch mode. * samples are aggregated by the key defined by getkey(). * todo merge error count into parent class?
DESIGN	todo should errors be thrown back through rmi?
DESIGN	todo - perhaps save other items such as headers?
DESIGN	todo should class implement samplelistener?
DESIGN	settings readresolve sets these from the server/client values as appropriate todo would be nice to make these final not 100% sure volatile is needed as not changed after creation
DESIGN	make it easier to enter a tab (can use \ but that is awkward)
DESIGN	todo turn into method?
DESIGN	does not appear to be used (yet)
DESIGN	"@guardedby(""samplestore"") todo perhaps use concurrenthashmap ?"
DESIGN	should the samples be aggregated on thread name or thread group (default) ?
DESIGN	todo clazz is probably always the same as testclass
DESIGN	todo - should this be restored?
DESIGN	todo provide proper name?
DESIGN	todo does it matter that an empty line will terminate the loop? csv output files should never contain empty lines so probably not if so then need to check whether the reader is at eof
DESIGN	* todo - convert to work more like upgrade.properties/nameupdater.java * * special processing is carried out for the header class the string * property testelement.name is converted to header.name for example * mozilla%2f4.0+%28compatible%3b+msie+5.5%3b+windows+98%29 * user-agent * becomes mozilla%2f4.0+%28compatible%3b+msie+5.5%3b+windows+98%29 * user-agent
DESIGN	* these must be set before reading/writing the xml. rather a hack but * saves changing all the method calls to include an extra variable. * * afaik the variables should only be accessed from one thread so no need to synchronize.
DESIGN	todo should this be restored?
DESIGN	todo not used - make private?
DESIGN	todo appears to duplicate the threadname field in sampleresult
DESIGN	yuck tiffimageencoder uses error to report runtime problems
DESIGN	todo should this implement supportscustomeditor() ?
DESIGN	a check just in case
DESIGN	not used as the element is generated by the resultcollector class
DESIGN	"* * check if a string is a valid jmeter 'expression'. * * the current implementation is very basic it just accepts any string * containing ""${"" as a valid expression. todo improve but keep returning * true for ""${}""."
DESIGN	todo - use or remove
DESIGN	i guess this can happen as a result of a bad file read? in this case it would be better to replace the incorrect value with anything valid e.g. the default value for the property. but for the time being i just prefer to be aware of any problems occuring here most likely programming errors so I will bail out. (ms note) cannot bail out - newly create elements have blank values and must get the defaults. also when loading previous versions of jmeter test scripts some values may not be right and should get default values - ms todo review this and possibly change to
DESIGN	todo does not work yet need to determine the sample type
DESIGN	programming error bail out.
DESIGN	temporary fix to allow default protocol to be changed
DESIGN	todo consider using private logs for each derived class
DESIGN	does not appear to be used yet
DESIGN	todo temporary hack to avoid unnecessary bug reports for subclasses
DESIGN	todo - yet another ambiguous name - does it need changing? see also clearable jmeterguicomponent
DESIGN	todo is this silent exception intended
DESIGN	* the following variables are set by standardjmeterengine. * this is done before start() is called so the values will be published to the thread safely * todo - consider passing them to the constructor so that they can be made final * (to avoid adding lots of parameters perhaps have a parameter wrapper object.
DESIGN	todo should this set the thread names for all the subsamples? might be more efficient than fetching the name elsewehere
DESIGN	* setting samplingstarted before the contollers are initialised allows * them to access the running values of functions and variables (however * it does not seem to help with the listeners)
DESIGN	todo remove this useless entry parameter
DESIGN	surely this is always null in the constructor?
DESIGN	todo why not use the super class value?
DESIGN	todo - does not appear to be called directly
DESIGN	* * custom trustmanager ignores all certificate errors * * todo implement conditional checking and logging * * (derived from authsslx509trustmanager in contrib directory)
DESIGN	maps to contain page and form encodings todo - do these really need to be shared between all proxy instances?
DESIGN	note source and line arguments are nonsense in a call(). any way to make these arguments *sensible?
DESIGN	is it an exception wrapped in a javascriptexception?
DESIGN	todo why empty block ?
DESIGN	todo - perhaps this should be a fatal error?
DESIGN	clone will produce correct type todo but why do we need to clone the list?
DESIGN	todo only called by userparameterxmlparser.getxmlparameters which is a deprecated class
DESIGN	todo probably not needed
DESIGN	todo needs to be synch? probably not changed after threads have started jmeter home directory (excludes trailing separator) jmeter bin directory (excludes trailing separator)
DESIGN	"hack bsh-2.0b5.jar bshscriptengine implements compilable but throws ""java.lang.error unimplemented"""
DESIGN	todo only clear the relevant entry - if possible
DESIGN	todo what is this for?
DESIGN	todo is sync really needed?
DESIGN	todo is this correct?
DESIGN	"todo cpercent is the same as cmedian here - why? and why pass it to ""distributionline""?"
DESIGN	todo should equals and hashcode depend on field other than count?
DESIGN	todo does this method need to be public? it is not currently called outside of this class.
DESIGN	todo should the method signature of this method be changed to match the super-implementation (using a testelement parameter instead of abstractlistenerelement)? this would require an instanceof check before adding the listener (below) but would also make the behavior a bit more obvious for sub-classes -- the java rules dealing with this situation are not always intuitive and a subclass may think it is calling this version of the method when it is really calling the superclass version instead.
DESIGN	todo should this method be synchronized ? all other function execute are
DESIGN	todo should the engine be static?
DESIGN	n.b. commons io ioutils has equivalent methods these were added before io was included todo - perhaps deprecate these in favour of commons io?
DESIGN	todo should this be getmin()?
DESIGN	* fix bug -d arg1=arg2 was causing parse error however * --define arg1=arg2 is ok this seems to be because the parser * skips the terminator for the long options but was not doing * so for the short options.
DESIGN	todo improve the error handling
DESIGN	* * add logtargets to root logger * fixme what is the clean way to add a logtarget afterwards ? * @param logtargets logtarget array
DESIGN	hack to reduce the need to load every class in non-gui mode which only needs functions todo perhaps use bcel to scan class files instead? class name should contain this string class name should not contain this string
DESIGN	* todo exact ordering is only required for some tests change the * comparison to do a set compare where necessary.
DESIGN	todo - improve this check
DESIGN	todo - could this be return?
DESIGN	todo field always true what for ?
DESIGN	very wrong.
DESIGN	todo - should this be a failure?
DESIGN	* wrapper to convert a junit4 class into a testcase * * todo - work out how to convert junit4 assertions so they are treated as failures rather than errors
DESIGN	method is broken anyway
DESIGN	todo should really return most specific (i.e. longest) match.
DESIGN	todo - should this be done for embedded usage? note the element is a configtestelement when used standalone so we cannot use ftpsampler access methods
DESIGN	"todo replace all this url2 mess with a proper method ""areequivalent(url1 url2)"" that would also ignore case in protocol and host names etc. -- use that method in the cookiemanager too."
DESIGN	todo is this possible?
DESIGN	* holder for storing cache details. * perhaps add original response later?
DESIGN	todo not used by gui
DESIGN	not currently used
DESIGN	todo correct url?
DESIGN	note the handling of simple- vs. double-quotes could be formally more accurate but i cannot imagine a session id containing either so we should be ok. the whole set of expressions is a quick hack anyway so who cares.
DESIGN	* todo improve string version to better match browser behaviour? e.g. * do browsers regard and as the same? if * so it would be better to reflect this in the string
DESIGN	code also allows for lf only (not sure why - perhaps because the test code uses it?)
DESIGN	todo find a way to avoid the cost of creating a string here -- probably a new patternmatcherinput working on a byte[] would do better.
DESIGN	todo should setbaseforscript be called here rather than above?
DESIGN	java 1.6.0_22+ no longer allows content-length to be set so do not check it. see todo any point in checking the other headers?
DESIGN	sampleevent is not passed jmetervariables because they do not make sense for proxy recording todo - is this the correct threadgroup name?
DESIGN	todo needs cleaning up
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ todo should this be a variable?
DESIGN	hack to skip processing
DESIGN	todo replace repeated substr() above and below with more efficient method.
DESIGN	todo perhaps make more specific than this? no point parsing anything else e.g. gif
DESIGN	will not work writeerrortoclient( generate result (if nec.) and populate it hack to skip processing
DESIGN	todo - should this be done when the client is created? if so then the details need to be added as part of
DESIGN	todo hack to be removed later
DESIGN	could we drop the sync here?
DESIGN	todo - should lf-only eol be allowed?
DESIGN	dircontext dc = todo perhaps return this?
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ todo - change to use url version? will this affect test plans?
DESIGN	todo specify collection type without breaking callers

DESIGN	does not appear to be used
DESIGN	notused guipackage guipack =

DESIGN	todo does not appear to be used
DESIGN	todo not used?
DESIGN	todo make static?
DESIGN	hack to allow entire url to be provided in host field
DESIGN	todo should this be ok ? assertequals(contentencoding s.getcontentencoding()) check arguments we should have one argument with the value equal to the post body
DESIGN	todo downcase upper case non-final variables
DESIGN	todo - belongs elsewhere
DESIGN	todo can this happen?
DESIGN	todo needed here because currently done on sample completion in jmeterthread but that only catches top-level samples.
DESIGN	todo this is a bit fragile
DESIGN	todo is this correct? if this is not the first file we cannot write its header now for simplicity we always save it even if there is only one file
DESIGN	todo - should this return something else?
DESIGN	do not allow override of content-length this helps with soapsampler hack too todo - what other headers are not allowed?
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ todo should this be variable?
DESIGN	may be replaced later
DESIGN	todo do we need to add a charset for the file contents? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	todo merge put and post methods as far as possible. e.g. post checks for multipart form/files and if not invokes senddata(
DESIGN	get the content length it tells us how much data to read todo maybe support chunked encoding then we cannot rely on content length
DESIGN	todo is this the correct default?
DESIGN	todo - is this the correct default?
DESIGN	todo should we allow mimetype only?
DESIGN	* todo should these fields be public? * they do not appear to be used externally. * * also are they any different from etc. ? * in some cases they seem to be used as the method name from the tomcat log. * however the rmethod field is used as the value for * for which is most approriate.
DESIGN	notused org.apache.jmeter.monitor.model.status st = todo - charset?
DESIGN	remember to change this when the class changes
DESIGN	todo find out how to retrieve these from the script at present the script has to use sampleresult methods to set them. $non-nls-1$ $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	todo process warnings? set code and message to success?
DESIGN	todo - should the encoding be configurable? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	$non-nls-1$ todo - probably wrong
DESIGN	todo method with 0 reference really useful ?
DESIGN	maybe we should consider creating a global cache for the random files to make jmeter more efficient.
DESIGN	* jmetertreenode and testbeangui are special gui classes and * are not intended to be added to menus * * todo find a better way of checking this
DESIGN	menubar related methods todo do we really need to have all these menubar methods duplicated here? perhaps we can make the menu bar accessible through guipackage?
DESIGN	should we use java.naming.security.[principal|credentials] to create the queueconnection?
DESIGN	todo set different status if not enough messages found?
DESIGN	todo fix this when there is a real implementation
DESIGN	allow serializable test to work todo is the serializable test necessary now that jmetertreenode is no longer a gui component?
DESIGN	* * fixme broken code
DESIGN	notused private string chosenfile
DESIGN	"* find all beans out there and check their resource property files - check * that non-default property files do not have any extra keys. - check all * necessary properties are defined at least in the default property file * except for beans whose name contains ""experimental"" or ""alpha"". * * todo - check property files do not have duplicate keys (is this important) *"
DESIGN	this could perhaps be a variable name
DESIGN	"results.setresponsecode(""???"") todo what code should be set here?"
DESIGN	"should we add the ""_"" separator?"
DESIGN	todo - should we skip processing here?
DESIGN	todo add some real tests now that split() has been removed
DESIGN	not used transient protected threadgroup threadgroup = null anyway was this supposed to be the class from java.lang or jmeter.threads?
DESIGN	all the others could be private too?
DESIGN	todo can this ever happen?
DESIGN	todo fetch list of languages from a file? n.b. changes to language list need to be reflected in resources/packagetest.java
DESIGN	todo move to utils class (jmeterutils?)
DESIGN	todo do we need to implement any kind of connection pooling? if so which connections should be shared? should threads share connections to the same destination? what about cross-thread sharing?
DESIGN	todo ought to be a filechooser
DESIGN	set the content type todo - needed? string multipartcontenttype = multipart.getcontenttype().getvalue() post.setheader(header_content_type multipartcontenttype)
DESIGN	* todo this assumes that the redirected response will always immediately follow the original response. * this may not always be true. * is there a better way to do this?
DESIGN	todo is it the best way ?
DESIGN	keep the unexpanded path todo - allow directories to end with .jar by removing this check?
DESIGN	todo the above works in the current situation but it is just a hack. how to get each editor to report whether it wants to grow bigger? whether the property label should be at the left or at the top of the editor? ?
DESIGN	hack save the package for any transaction controllers
DESIGN	how many classes can we assign from? todo there must be a nicer way
DESIGN	should the testbean be hidden?
DESIGN	todo - why lower case? ok to use the default locale?
DESIGN	a hack to make user-defined variables in the testplan element more dynamic
DESIGN	hack force the controller to load its tree
DESIGN	it might be useful also to make this available in the 'request' tab for when posting json.
DESIGN	should header be saved with the data? $non-nls-1$
DESIGN	"showing large strings can be very costly so we will avoid doing so if the response data is larger than 200k. todo instead we could delay doing the result.settext call until the user chooses the ""response data"" tab. plus we could warn the user if this happens and revert the choice if he does not confirm he is ready to wait."
DESIGN	n.b. needs to implement visualizer so that testbeangui can find the correct gui class
DESIGN	todo strings should be resources
DESIGN	result.seterror(true) todo is this the correct strategy? throw exception allow assertion to pass
DESIGN	why does this not call guiinstance.cleartestplan() ? is there a reason for not clearing everything?

IMPLEMENTATION	set the overall status for the transaction sample todo improve e.g. by adding counts to the sampleresult class
IMPLEMENTATION	should we exit at end of the test? (only applies to server because host is non-null)
IMPLEMENTATION	* have we reached the reporting boundary? * need to allow for a margin of error otherwise can miss the slot. * also need to check we have not hit the window already
IMPLEMENTATION	todo save hostname save sample type (plain or
IMPLEMENTATION	remind convert arg list vectors here?
IMPLEMENTATION	it is chunked transfer encoding which we do not really support yet. so we just read without blocking because we do not know when to stop reading so we cannot block todo propery implement support for chunked transfer i.e. to know when we have read the whole request and therefore allow the reading to block
IMPLEMENTATION	allow the mimetype of the file to control the content type this is not obvious in gui if you are not uploading any files but just sending the content of nameless parameters todo needs a multiple file upload scenerio
IMPLEMENTATION	todo handle filenames
IMPLEMENTATION	not yet handled
IMPLEMENTATION	todo - should check that error has been logged

WITHOUT_CLASSIFICATION	an additional note on using hashsets to store urls i just discovered that obtaining the hashcode of a java.net.url implies a domain-name resolution process. this means significant delays can occur even more so if the domain name is not resolvable. whether this can be a problem in practical situations i cannot tell but thought I would keep a note just in case btw note that using a list and removing duplicates via scan would not help since url.equals requires name resolution too. the above problem has now been addressed with the urlstring and urlcollection classes.
